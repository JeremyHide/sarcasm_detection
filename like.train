Because they are betting that if you are already buying their speakers, you'll likely want to buy one of their subs too, especially if some slimey and/or ignorant salesperson tells you that you MUST ""match"" the sub and speakers. This PSW10 is a prime example. If you are in a small room and listening to jazz or rock music, it's not too bad. Use it while blasting hip-hop, or watching a special-effects loaded movie like ""Jurassic Park"" or ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and you won't even know it's there---it simply does not go low enough nor loud enough (let's not even talk about if it's clean enough) to do the job.

OK, Dracula could do it if he were well fed, so why not? But sparkles? Anyway on to the meat of this review... (which will likely get thoroughly ignored as there seems to be so much hype over this flick) As far as I can tell, Twilight has no plot. At all. There aren't any conflicts until the last 20 minutes or so. There isn't any drama. This is a vampire movie with no conflict among the main characters, only teen angst and Bella and Edward mooning over each other. The dialog between Edward and Bella would be better if it were done with semaphore flags. Thank goodness I had rifftrax going during those awkward silences. The really sad part is that neither of them really seems to have any real reason to angst over their boring lives. Nothing's really keeping them apart. The few glimpses of indistinguishable backup high schoolers didn't have anyone telling Bella what a horrible person she was and no one went to torment ""the new girl."" Anything that could be remotely called interesting would have been centered around Bella's sheriff dad and the ""maulings"" (read: vampire attacks) he's investigating. But the script instead goes to focus on Bella and Edward's wangsting. Anyone who thinks of Bella as a Mary Sue, I agree. This is perhaps the worst case of published marysueitis I have ever run across. Everyone likes her. She always gets her way. People drop everything to save her even if they have utterly no interest to do so. To make things worse, I found her to be a horrible character in general. There's one scene where one of the indistinguishable backup high schoolers is asking her out to the prom and she isn't paying the poor bit character the slightest whit of attention, preferring to gaze longingly at Edward in the distance. I'm sorry, but that's just rude and under most circumstances would probably make someone a bit miffed. I don't care if the poor guy is a bit character, I'd rather a small look at any of the their small dramas, because I could at least see that they had things going on in their lives from the tiny glimpses shown in the film. Speaking of small bit characters, the best one is some poor construction or engineering guy in a hard hat who finds himself hunted by the ""OMG bad vampires."" I'll give the redshirt credit, the shadowplay on the screen says that he gave them a fight and with an iota more depth, he would have fought them off. :) Go redshirt, go! I'm told that scene was not in the books. It makes me lose all desire to ever read them. As seems to be the trend for this movie, the villains aren't developed at all. They are clearly ""OMG EVOL!!!1!!"" because they act like, well, normal vampires and because they see Bella as an interesting snack. Were they given more depth or a motive at all, I probably would have started to root for them. As it was, I was bored silly. Aesthetically speaking, the film wasn't terrible, although I could have done with less cool toned lighting. Kirsten Stewart is a pale deadpan enough without the camera making it even more obvious. Also, the soundtrack has a rather pretty piano piece in the middle, supposedly composed by Robert Pattinson. I hope he manages to get himself fired from the sequels before his entire career goes down the drain. He played a good Cedric in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I wouldn't recommend Twilight to anyone. No amount of pretty camera work or tiny scene additions could save this movie from a script that would have been better used as toilet paper."

If you've had periodontal work or had root canal, implants, crowns or bridges done, you know that figure is not an exaggeration, and you're lucky if your insurance covers even a little bit of it. Having seen my relatives go through that, I've decided that as I get older, I want to spend my money on vacations and real estate, and not on painful dental procedures. That's why the Sonicare is the most frugal product I've bought. I too have had some costly dental work, and I'm determined to keep my fixed-up choppers in tip-top condition. This toothbrush is amazing. One thing very few people note about the Sonicare is that it not only cleans your teeth beautifully, it also keeps your gums in great shape, and that may be even more valuable. Here's the best testimonial to the Sonicare: I recently had braces for a few years. I mentioned to my orthodontist that I'd graduated from high school in 1983, and she said, ""You're not that old."" ""Yes, I'm 40,"" I said. She actually checked my chart! ""Well, your teeth and gums look like they belong to someone in their 20s!"" she concluded. Please invest wisely and don't skimp on dental care. I've had other electric toothbrushes (Oral B) and tried every kind of tooth cleaning brush, powder, and gimmick you can imagine. This is the one I've used for the last 5 years (I used the earlier Sonicare model for about 5 years before that), and this is the one I'm sticking with. My annual checkups confirm I've been making the right choice. Incidentally (inci ""dental"" ly?), Amazon's price on these heads is excellent -- much cheaper than my local pharmacies. A two-pack will last a year, since these heads wear out like clockwork at about 6 months. That works out to a little over $1.85 a month. Heck, you could spend that on regular toothbrushes!"

This bread takes 35 minutes of kneading with my powerful Kenwood Major mixer, but the Kenwood mixer walks around the counter as it slams the doughball, so I looked forward to Clayton's 7-minute Cuisinart kneading time. The light batter lifted up the blade and allowed seepage all around the bowl before I reached 2/3 of the claimed 6-cups of flour capacity. It looked like ""the blob"" was back and about to eat Seattle. Customer service operator at Cuisinart left me on hold for 10 minutes while she ""went to get a blade,"" then disconnected me. Second half-hour call got me an operator who wouldn't hang up. She got the blade, confirmed that it does not ""snap in place"" as the first operator claimed,told me I had to use only Cuisinart bread recipes. This machine is only 570 watts -- info missing on the box -- and mine stopped with only 5 cups of flour and 2 cups of water -- well under the 6-cups of flour claimed capacity. Clayton offers adjusted recipes for food processors, but apparently he hadn't tested this ""gem."" If you want to do various breads, forget the Cuisinart 2011.

Fascinating! Now, can I run out and build myself a prototype after reading the articles? Ummm, no. Do I know a whole lot more about an incredibly fun subject then I did before? Yes! This month's issue focuses on similar theme: The future of personal space travel and the idea of a space-hotel. When you're done reading it will you be able to build a rocket and fly to the moon? Of course not. But it's informative and educational to the exact level I would want it to be... just enough to make me aware, enlightened, and entertained.

like	1	"I understand that most of the reviews are fake and I would like to say that while I find them all very enjoyable and humorous, there is a something that a real customer of this product feels should be known. I purchased 10 of the rabbits for the purpose of making hare jerky (a tasty treat) when I was overcome with the desire to indulge in a bit of rabbit meat before the smoking process. Giving into my guilty urges, I took one rabbit for my own personal pre-jerky consumption and proceeded to eat the entire animal whole (I do not own a stove, only a plastic box and some firewood for smoking things, hence it was uncooked). After my little personal rabbit fiesta, I laid down to digest the food. This was a mistake. Within two hours, I had never felt worse. I used the trusty search engine ""Bing"" to do some armchair medical research while clutching a trashcan in the most horrendous gastric distress you can imagine (I do not have health insurance so I did not call the hospital). Quickly, I found out that a side effect to eating rabbit was ""protein poisoning,"" a situation that arises when lean meat is eaten. It is also known as ""rabbit starvation"" because rabbit meat contains almost no fat whatsoever. Apparently, consumption of large amounts of protein with little or no carbohydrates or fat is dangerous. Well you imagine how much that tickled me angry. All ready to write an angry letter of protest to the rabbit meat industry about their marketing of a dangerous foodstuff, I stumbled to my writing desk but alas, I only made it 3 feet before collapsing in pain. The next 5 hours were like a blur as I lay on the floor writhing in my own waste seeing people and things from the past and quite possibly the future. I have experimented with drugs back in the day and let me tell you, nothing came as close to disconnecting me from the universe in the worst way possible, as this. No one ever wants to experience protein poisoning, I promise you. At about 10 in the evening I came to and used a chair and the wall to help pull myself off of the floor. I still felt sick and I went back to my computer to see if there was a cure. Suddenly it hit me, I needed to eat other macronutrients! I remembered the tub of lard I had been saving in the fridge and stumbled across my apartment. The pain only grew worse. I remembered reading that bodybuilders eat lots of protein. I have no idea how they do it. It must be horrible for them. My vegan friend has always said that anything over 20 grams of a protein a day is overkill and I'm inclined to believe him now. He is the healthiest person I know, he is very skinny but he doesn't have visible muscle (which he says is the result of toxins and not enough body fat to properly survive). I finally reached my fridge and reached in for the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter container with my stockpiled lard. I quickly shoveled it into my mouth and wouldn't you believe it but it only made me feel worse! I passed out again, the cold air of the fridge blowing onto me. I awoke three days later (according to my watch) at 7 at night. The fridge had apparently preserved my body as it fought the proteins for the first night but now my electricity was off because my bill was due yesterday. It didn't matter, my body had apparently started to win the fight around 2 nights ago and now I am pretty much back to normal. However, I SINCERELY DO NOT RECOMMEND RABBIT MEAT as it can potentially kill you, as it nearly did me. Five stars - 1 for nearly killing me - 1 slightly chewy - 1 no head + 1 made great jerky = 3 stars"

like	1	"""Culture Warrior"" feels more like the worries and observations of someone who is watching history pass by and would like to turn the clock back. O'Reilly caters to the fears and worries of the conservative right by assuring them that we're the ""good guys"" and that Iraq is a just war(of course Mr. O'Reilly has never served a day in combat or actually participated in an armed conflict). ""Culture Warrior"" is a surprisingly short book, composed of much material from ""The O'Reilly Factor"" TV show, so it's not a very serious study to begin with, not because of the length, but because of the detail and quality of the content. At times O'Reilly comes across as one of those old-fashioned preachers who see Satan everywhere and must cast him out of your living room and television set. He taps into typical conservative slogans by using terms like ""we need to be warriors,"" ""you gotta fight back,"" ""Islamofascism."" He rants and raves about the key points to outdo your ""opponent"" when debating a ""Secular Progressive."" Like Buchanan, O'Reilly is shouting for an America that is quickly fading into the past, if it has not already faded. I would think a ""Culture Warrior"" would realize that cultures change, evolve, for better or worse, nothing stays the same forever. Like Ann Coulter, much of O'Reilly's prose here caters more to the elites in America, with disturbing undertones in the descriptions of ""lower class"" America.

That is to say, delete in top right, escape top left and CTL bottom left, with arrow keys on the bottom right.  Also, it doesn't have the rarely needed numeric keypad, which is found on a lot of keyboards these days but requires your hand placement left of expected to type, which is what you do most of the time anyhow, right?  I like this keyboard better than those on the legendary Thinkpads of old.  The screen is nice and sharp, I don't dislike the shiny screen as much as I had originally expected.  Colors are great.  Hard drive has enough space for me, and the recovery procedure works well.  I made the recovery CDs as well, but I normally just clone the HD onto and old drive to have a backup that way.   The computer has nice selection of features, minus the HDMI that has been mentioned already.    I am very fond of the trackpad .. I grew up with IBMs and prefer the pointer stick, but this is the nicest trackpad I've ever used.  Buttons are in the right places and are the right size.  Speakers are OK, better than many budget laptops.  The recessed keyboard is a nice looking design and the textured case is also quite cool looking.  This certainly doesn't look like a budget laptop.   There are a few negatives however.  First, Sony loads a ridiculous amount of "junkware" on this computer.  Trial versions of this and that, utilities of dubious importance, and a bunch of other junk I see no need for.  I took me about 45 minutes to get rid most of the egregious stuff.  The processor is 64 bit, and the Win7 version is 64 bit, which makes sense given the 4GB ram installed.  The processor does not have the Intel virtualization technology, but frankly having used Sun's free and excellent Virtual Box software for some time, which doesn't need this virtualization technology, I see no need for Intel's hardware virtualization.    Also, the computer ain't a light weight although it isn't a complete pig either.    I also installed XP Professional for giggles, the drivers are all available on Sony's site.  Man, it really flies with 32 bit XP.    All in all a very nice budget laptop.

Second, here is why you should buy it. &quot;Either/Or&quot; is Elliot's 3rd solo release, following 3 albums and several EPs with the Portland indie/grunge band Heatmiser. I can't speak for &quot;roman candle&quot; or &quot;Elliot Smith,&quot; but i can tell you about this album...which is one of the best i have ever heard.  As several other reviews said, this album has an ethereal, acoustic sound, best compared to Simon and Garfunkel or Nick Drake. The songs - short, but beautiful - are vintage Elliot, with moody, depressing lyrics generally about the girl who got away - and why it's his own fault. &quot;Nobody broke your heart...you broke your own cuz you can't finish what you start,&quot; he chants over and over on &quot;Alameda.&quot; Elliot utilizes both complex, Dylanesque lines along with simple, powerful phrases like the chorus of &quot;Ballad of Big Nothing&quot; to create truly moving songs...and if that's not enough, Elliot is a fine singer.  The highlight of many songs is the vocal melody, especially on the bright &quot;Rose Parade.&quot; Elliot's trademarke guitar work is here, of course - his pick/strum chord-oriented songs comprise the bulk of the album. The music stands on it's own, yet creates a suberb backing for Elliot's singing and lyrics. This is one of his best albums, and i would consider it stronger than XO, which has been more universally acclaimed (even by this website!). A few standout tracks - of course, the songs from Good Will Hunting... &quot;Ballad of Big Nothing&quot; &quot;Say Yes&quot; and &quot;Between the Bars.&quot; The entire album is great, however, with not a single weak track.  You should pick this one up - everyone should give &quot;Either/Or&quot; a chance, because someday it will stand as one of the finest albums produced during the 1990's...and maybe ever.

It wasn't long, though, after my DX arrived the day before yesterday before disappointment set in.  Don't get me wrong, there is a LOT to like about the DX:  1) Pictures are awesome on it, if the publisher formats them properly.  2) Those who complain about darkness of text on their K2 (a problem I've never had, btw) will be thrilled by the DX's very dark text.  3) The ability to rotate the screen is great.  Gives you a closer look at things like maps and charts.  4) The browser is a bit faster than on the K1 or K2, though that isn't saying much--it is still very clunky to use.  5) But web pages look pretty good on the DX.  6) It holds 3500 books.   BUT.....the DX just isn't all that.  It has drawbacks that are really making me consider sending it back before my 30 days are up:  1) First and foremost, while it is true that it natively reads PDFs, it is really only a PDF *viewer*.  You can't change the font size on PDFs, links will not function on them, and the ability to magnify pictures doesn't work on them either. So you better have LARGE fonts on your PDF before you load it.  Looking at the PDF in horizontal mode helps a bit, but not by much.  2) The DX is too big to hold comfortably.  It's not really all that heavy, but it is top heavy and you feel a pull on your hands.  And that pull is really evident if you try to use the keyboard while holding it--you practically have to lay the DX down flat, it becomes so difficult to type.  3) They merged the number keys with the QWERTY keys (losing a line of keys). What development genius thought it would be helpful and an "improvement" to have to press the ALT key every time you wanted to type a number?!?  4) Before my DX came, I really didn't think this would bother me at all, but I have to say: I really HATE the fact that the "next page" button is only on one side. I mostly use the left hand button. And yes, with the DX's rotation ability you can turn it upside down, placing the "next page" button on the left side.... However, when you do this, the button is so high up that you have to slide your hand (not your thumb, your whole hand) up in order to turn the page. May sound nit-picky, but it is truly a PITA to break off reading to do it. Not only that, but having the keyboard at the top makes it even more top-heavy than when it is right side up!  5) when you rotate the DX so that it is horizontal, the "next page" button is either at the bottom or the top--in either case you can't just flick your thumb and change the page. Again, a PITA.  6)  If you leave the rotation feature on "Auto" when you are not using your DX it drains your battery, so you must remember to turn the feature off when you stop reading.  7) Still no folders.  An organization nightmare three times bigger than that of the K2 (which itself had increased the same problem on the K1):  the possibility of storing 3500 books but only being able to sort them by author, title, and "most recent first."    I will be fiercely debating with myself in the next week or so, on whether I really want to keep the DX.  It is so disappointing.  It has the potential of being a really great e-reader...but as it stands now, it isn't.  It's OK.  But for $489, it should be a lot more than merely OK.

Despite the spotty reviews on this one, we bought it for half retail price in the Fall and gave it to our kids (4 and 6) for Christmas.   Oh the pain of having to wait for warm TX weather to use it!  But it was so worth the wait.  We have used it several times now with no problems and the kids are THRILLED with it.  Here are my tips and observations:  Dump a few ounces of tear-free soap at the top of the slide ramp and along the outer edge of the curve.  This has many benefits: It helps to prevent fabric burns on knees, elbows, shoulders, etc that come into contact with a dry part during sliding.  It makes the slide a bit faster.  It creates bubbles in the pool part, which the kids enjoy.  It helps to clean the fabric and gives it a nice scent (instead of mold).   When the kids are done, drain the pool, grab the top handle of the stair part and flip the whole thing upside down while it's running.  This allows water to come out of the footholds and the air chambers.  (I'm not sure why this slide takes water into the air chambers along the bottom, but it does.  And for some reason it leaks back out much better upside down.) Finally, you're going to want to allow a couple hours after use to keep it up and running in order for it to dry.  Be sure to drag it to a dry spot in the yard so it'll dry underneath too. If you fold it up damp at all, it will grow mold.  (They all do that.)    Yes it's heavy.  It's a huge water slide.  But I'm a 5'3" woman and I can set it up and take it down by myself.  In fact, this is the very first inflatable I've ever had that I could actually get to fit in the storage bag provided.  It takes some precision folding, but I've gotten that sucker into the bag all by myself every time.   My last tip is that this is actually fun to use dry as well.  You won't be able to slide on it, but my kids have spent hours of imaginative play with it in the evenings after school this spring.  They pretend it's a ship and they sit in the crow's nest (top of the slide) to look out over the ocean.  They throw out anchors in storms and save mermaids and lots of other missions that require endless trips up and down the ramp.  Our own backyard theater production.  So far no problems with any rips or tears in the seams, and that's even with two jack russells that constantly jump onto the lower air chambers, with their sharp little talons.  I highly recommend this slide, but it's not worth retail price.  Find it like we did at half price, no tax and free shipping... That's a deal worth buying.

I wanted professional icecream shakes in the comfort of my own home and this mixer really delivers. It came with a reciepe book for perfect shakes and other things. I recommend the PBC Shake (Peanut Butter and Chocolate - mmmmmmm, it's yummy!) Easy to use, easy to clean. A real joy to have when entertaining. I would definately make this purchase again.

Overall it doesn't affect its performance if you screw the handle in so the curve bends like a camels back down to the broom brush. If you have the curve to the left or the right when your pushing it bends more & is harder to push forward when pushing much sand or gravel away from the cement.  The brush itself works great, some of the bristles fall out here and there but doesn't wear fast overall. If I didn't receive a bent handle I am sure I would have fully approved this product.
like	0	Bottom Line: The author really didn't have enough time to let this mature, and didn't have a good editor. You need both to create something really enduring.  I read an article the other day in the Dallas Morning News about the disposable book:  how publishers are now out to milk authors for all they can get in the short-term, with no thought to longevity or sustaining a publishing relationship. I'm sad to find this so true.  I was pretty much overwhelmed by fellow teachers who are obsessed; I was actually awed the other day when two colleagues got into feverish exchange over whether Bella should ultimately choose Edward or Jacob. It was at that point that my own fate was sealed and I knew I had to read it. I digested it in less than a two-day period, and now I will quickly outline the Good, the Bad and the Ugly:  The Good I'm surprised at the people who attack Meyer's characterization. She's actually pretty good at it. For the most part, her characters are fun, well-rounded, dynamic, complex--everything you want in a good story. Bella is believable and easy to like. I find it easy to identify with her, but as abnormal as I am, I can see how if I identify with her, others might find her completely foreign and unbelievable. :~) The only weakness that sneaks in Meyer's characterization lies with the bad guys; they're given very little opportunity to develop in relationship to the rest of the novel.  Additionally, Meyer is very good at creating suspense. If nothing else, the book is a great page-turner. The reader is hypnotically bound to follow through simply by the sheer force of the words on the pages. The story itself is very easy to get lost in.  Meyer definitely hit on an intriguing story-line. It's different, it's compelling. Unfortunately, it just wasn't enough.  The Bad Meyer works a little too hard to make her 'good' vampires altruistic. There is a lot of explaining away, a lot of conveniences that in small doses do no harm, but over the long haul add up like water wearing down a rock. Further, the book is a little verbose for the material. A great deal of condensing could have been done to the book's benefit. Moreover, there are several places in the book that are meant to be one thing (like romantic) and come off as another (cringe-inducing). I sometimes felt like I was watching a personal fantasy, and whoa, that's not my thing....  The Ugly Here's the rub: As much Meyer tries to make Edward good, nothing can atone for what he is. For Bella and Edward to go on forever the way they are is an impossibility. Everyone knows something has to give. The option given in the book, for Bella to become a vampire, isn't really allowable from a publishing standpoint. Think about it: The target audience is young adult. Most young adult readers are female. For Bella to become a vampire would send a message to millions of young girls that in order to 'get the guy' you have to cut yourself off from everyone who has previously cared about you and go through physical suffering and die an eternal death, going from human to soulless companion. Yikes! The political repercussions have me betting that Bella won't become a vampire anytime soon. The author has really written herself in a corner here, which wouldn't be fatal (no pun intended) if she could come up with something truly supernatural and redemptive for Edward to bring him back to Bella's level. But that's not so glamorous in today's climate. :~/  There are other smaller problems, such as Edward's schizoid transformations from angry to humored and back, and the fact that (maybe I'm alone!) no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't envision a deathly pale and anemic looking guy who's really cold to be anywhere near attractive or sexually appealing or anywhere in Greek god territory. It could have something to do with the fact that my husband is a gorgeous blonde who just emanates vitality, and I'm too used to that, but I still found it so difficult to reconcile that it stood out to me.  It seemed to me that these, and other smaller plot points, could all have been resolved with time and editing. I also found it unthinkable that there would have to be 3 sequels to resolve anything. There doesn't seem to be enough material to work with there while satisfying curious readers who really just want to know if there's any way for Bella and Edward to be together.   This is a great summer read for fun, but it pains me because it really could have been so much better. Overall, Meyer is an impressive author, but this is yet another read that goes into the 'good-but-could-have-been-genius' category.

I have had some experience with LG Bluray before since I own the also excellent BD390 so when I needed another one for a different room in the house the newer model LG was at the top of my list.  Having owned it for a few weeks I have the following to note.  Pros  1.   Fast Blu-Ray loading times.   Very crisp clear image and fortunately since I own a receiver capable of decoding Lossless HD formats I really like the sound as well.   Does the Blu ray format justice 2,   My favorite aspect of this and the BD 390 by far is the VUDU functionality.  I think Vudu is a tremendous service (perhaps will get even better now that's its been purchased by Wal-Mart).   To have a large library of 1080p HD available at your fingertips is fantastic and the LG does a nice job displaying very pleasing audio and video off Vudu.  I would buy this for this feature alone. 3,  Although no shortage of Netflix ready devices in my HT lineup having this and other internet sources such as Pandora are nice options. 4.  I read some complaints about the new interface compared to the older LGs but to my eyes its nicer looking and just as easy to navigate 5.  I used Ethernet to connect this player but did test out the 802.11n and was able to connect to my Airport Extreme powered network with no problems 6.  CD ripping is a great feature and I was able to archive a library of 200 CDs or so with little trouble.   Gracenote does a nice job tagging the tracks.   Cons I really didn't find much not to like about this player.    Mostly just nice to haves.  I would have liked if it supported Amazon VOD since that's my other source for video and I did think that the footprint was still a little large although sleeker and lighter that my older model.  I first lucked into the BD390 when it was highly recommended by a HT installer.  I am pleased to note that the 590 is a nice upgrade with newer functionality on an old favorite.   Highly recommended.

She is drawn to one in particular that has stunning yellow eyes, and she's certain that it is the same wolf who saved her from a pack of wolves who attacked her when she was a young girl.  Sam leads two lives. In the spring and summer, he's human, but when the cooler temperatures of autumn descend upon him, it's not long before he turns into a wolf for the winter. The problem with being a werewolf is that the longer you're a wolf, the less time you spend in your human form until one spring, you don't change back and are forever a part of the wolf world.  When Grace meets Sam, one look at his yellow eyes makes her certain that he's her wolf. They are drawn to each other and it doesn't take them long to realize that they've been in love for years as impossible as it may seem. As the temperatures get cooler, Sam and Grace struggle to keep him human, but the bitter cold and other obstacles threaten to take him away from her forever.  What I love about Maggie Stiefvater's writing, especially in Shiver, is that it's completely seamless: the transitions between the two main characters' points of view and the way that she brings werewolves into what seems like a perfectly normal world. I'm one of those people who rarely reads chapter titles or headings because I find them distracting, and not once did I have to glance up at the beginning of a chapter to see who was speaking. Sam and Grace have their own distinct voices and characteristics, but the switch from character to character is not jarring the way I've seen it in a lot of other books. And the coolest thing? Grace and Sam each have their own strengths and complement each other well. I love to see strong female characters in books for teens, and Grace is definitely smart and strong and can take care of herself.  But what I love the most about Ms. Stiefvater's writing is her ability to depict chemistry between two characters--first with Dee and Luke in Lament and now with Sam and Grace. She's masterful at showing and not telling: glances, touches, dialogue, and thoughts all create a completely believable love between a girl and a werewolf.  Shiver is a perfectly executed book, and I continue to be impressed with Maggie Stiefvater's writing.

I'm a fit person who works out everyday so I didn't expect too much from it, but hey it's The Girls Next Door so I had to do it. The fifteen minutes with Holly was a nice toning workout to hit some of those difficult places. Then it came to Bridget and man I was sweating like you wouldn't believe by the end of that one. With Kendra, it was an awesome power workout at the end of the dvd. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good time hitting some key places that everyone wants to look great. Great job Holly, Bridget and Kendra!

With the advent of decent cordless power tools (the first one that I had that was actually  useful for something was an 18 volt DeWalt drill that went right through stuff my corded drills wouldn't touch, but that's another story) I've been waiting for Dremel to come out with a good cordless. I've been hesitant about the earlier cordless Dremels but this one looks like &quot;it&quot;. So far it's done everything I've asked it to do but I haven't asked it to do much--I got it specifically to deal with a piece of acrylic that my cordless Rotozip melted instead of cutting--I figured the adjustable speed on the Dremel would take care of that and was right. Just an aside about stalling--if you're stalling a Dremel then it's time to take a good hard look at a Rotozip, which, if you've never played with one, is kind of a Dremel on steroids--Dremel has an equivalent, the &quot;Advantage&quot;, but only the one model and not cordless. The lack of a provision to charge the battery with the tool attached is just carrying through the current practice with cordless tools--it's assumed that one will have two batteries, one on the tool and one on charge if this is an issue.  There's space in the case for a second battery. A &quot;gotcha&quot; to be aware of with the lithium ion batteries, always store them charged--if they self-discharge below a certain point a protective circuit kicks in and they disable themselves--this is a safety issue--trying to recharge a lithium ion battery that is discharged below a certain point can result in an explosion (I'm not talking about a little spill--exploding lithium batteries in emergency-locator transmitters have brought down light aircraft). The bundled accessories are, near as I can figure it: Aluminum oxide stone #932 and #8193 Silicon carbide stone #84922 Aluminum oxide abrasive wheel #541 2 rubber polishing wheels #425 3 Large felt polishing wheels #429 5 Small felt polishing wheels #414 1 cutter, looks like a #181 1 drill bit, #150 1 Mandrel #401 (for felt pads etc) 1 Mandrel #402 (for sanding disks, cutoff wheels etc) Sanding cylinder mandrels 1/4&quot; and 1/2&quot; 4 80 grit 1/2&quot; sanding cylinders 3 120 grit 1/2&quot; sanding cylinders 4 80 grit 1/4&quot; sanding cylinders 3 120 grit 1/4&quot; sanding cylinders 11 sanding disks 17 cutoff wheels, 3 are thicker than the others, the others are in two containers of 10 and 4 but can't tell any difference between them. 1 wrench with screwdriver tip that fits screws on mandrels 1 case with a good deal of unused storage even after all the accessories are stored.

I appreciated the thought-prompting questions that encourage the inexperienced reader to think like a counselor. The authors include a wealth of ethical and legal facts and information and then explore potential outcomes, sharing their own views while encouraging the reader to come to their own conclusions concerning personal values.

The theme of the book is that the way we eat, the way we think about food and handle ourselves around it is the way we do everything. The author then shows us how and why this is the case. She describes the food retreats she runs and the women who attend them, and as a reader you will surely identify in some way with every single person--and with the lesson she illustrates from their lives. This is a more complex book than her earlier books because of the spiritual dimension; she sees problems with overeating as gateways to spiritual enlightenment. She convinced me (and will convince you as well) that instead of trying to get rid of or fix our eating problems, we need to use them to see within ourselves, to learn important spiritual life lessons from our feelings, and to grow and heal so that we will end up eating as a spiritual practice. And so that we'll have a permanent end to the misery of always struggling with our weight and self-image, and always striving to improve our relationship with food.   The book is so good that for me, just reading it was like a spiritual awakening in this area of my life. I found it motivational, inspirational, and scary in a good way--and the author makes the whole process doable with descriptions of practices that can be used on the food healing/awakening journey such as meditation, inquiry, and eating guidelines. These practices are all specific to the process and they are described in detail. This spiritual dimension is generic and does not require a particular religious belief, or even any religious belief. It would be compatible with any type of spirituality. The type of eating practiced is intuitive eating (listening to your body to discern what it wants), and no matter what your way of eating, you can apply an intuitive approach to it--this book is about a way of living and relating to food, not about a food plan.  If you have read the author's other books (as I have) you will find much new information here. Other key themes of the book include mindfulness, presence, and feeling your feelings. The author is brutal but honest in describing how destructive the dieting industry is to women. Again, this is definitely not a diet book or eating plan, but instead a way of experiencing life which allows you to be present and aware so that you are able to listen to your body and choose food based on nourishment and self-care.   Although it is a quick read (I read it in one evening), this book is so valuable that you will want to refer back to it, highlight it for future reference, take notes in the margins, and use parts for journal prompts. There is only one negative, and it is a biggy: the paper in this hardback book is similar to super cheap mass market paperback-type paper. I have never seen an actual book of any type with such paper, though! I tried to highlight sections and the highlighter not only would bleed through to the reverse side of the page, but sometimes onto the previous page! It is hard to describe how frustrating this was---a book that is a true keeper on throw-away paper. I highlighted anyway and my book is a mess, but I decided to rebuy it on Kindle when it comes out. I've never done this before, but it's that good of a book--worth months (or maybe years) of therapy. I also would buy it again if it is reprinted (and I'll bet it will be) with a paper that matches the quality of the book.   That flaw aside, I'm so glad I bought this book. I have read many, many books on overeating, diet and nutrition, self-help, styles of eating, and more, and this book stands apart from the crowd. The message is an important one for any woman who wants to handle her relationship with food, her weight, and her spirituality in a healthy way, and to become whole. If that is you, you will not be disappointed, I promise.  Highest recommendation. *****

All SLR cameras use mirrors, prisms, and optical viewfinders so that the photographer can see what his/her subject "through the lens."  SLRs have remained the defacto standard for most serious photographers because most find the whole viewfinder concept so appealing.  The micro 4/3 does away with the mirrors and prisms, and replaces the optical viewfinder of SLRs with an electronic viewfinder.  This allows the cameras that adhere to the standard to be much smaller (and wideangle lenses designed for this mount to be smaller as well).  Onto the real review...  The EVF on the G1 is the first that I've seen that is remotely usable.  While not as good as the OVF in my 5D, it is considerably better than the OVF in my older 350D.  The first look through the EVF will impress anyone who hasn't used a Full-Frame camera before.  While there is a noticeable lag (particularly when moving the camera around...a delay of a 10th of a second maybe), the fact that you can see a live histogram in the VF makes the lag completely worthwhile.  Even better, the VF can increase the gain of the screen in darker conditions so you can actually see what you are shooting (it does get grainy, but it is better than seeing nothing at all).  Finally, when you engage Manual Focus, the view in the EVF zooms in on your subject automatically which allows for perfect manual focus adjustments every time!!  Without a doubt, this is the best interchangeable lens camera on the market if you are interested in manually focusing.  The articulating LCD is another design choice that is spot-on!!  Why haven't other manufacturers caught on that "live view" is completely useless without an articulating LCD?  Switching from the LCD to the EVF is as simple as putting your eye next to the viewfinder.  There is a sensor there that detects when it is being used.  The LCD doesn't have the super resolution of the new 5DMkII or the D700, but it has twice the resolution of my older 5D.  So is the camera pocketable?  Not a chance.  However, it isn't much bigger than the larger (with its kit lens) than modern superzoom Point&Shoot cameras.  I bought it because I found that I was leaving my 5D (with 24-70 f/2.8) at home more often than not because i didn't want to carry so much weight.  The G1, in comparison, is a joy to hold and carry.  For me, the size is just right.  Any smaller and the controls would be unusably small.  Any larger and the camera would begin to resemble smaller DSLRs.  Side Note:  The kit lens has to be seen to be believed...it is SO small.  Even the 45-200 lens (90-400) isn't much bigger than kit lenses for APS-C or FF cameras (let alone comparing it to the monstrous 100-400 lens that canon makes).  Noise is reasonable.  I wouldn't go past ISO1250 for prints with the G1.  ISO1600 and 3200 are more than useable for web viewing (which is how a majority of my pics are displayed).  I never really understood how printable ISO6400 prints are suddenly required for every camera...how many people actually print a large number of images anyways?  Downsized to Facebook or Picasaweb sizes, I would imagine that a ISO6400 G1 image would be more than adequate.  What I don't like is the lack of any large aperture lenses for the format.  You can buy adapters to use standard 4/3 lenses but the older 4/3 lenses are likely larger than their future micro43 counterparts (and AF doesn't work with many of them).  Adapters also exist for Leica M mount (I'm trying to convince my fiance that leica lenses are a better investment than the stock market right now...but I don't think that she is buying it).  The depth of field for micro43 is already larger due to the smaller sensor so it will be hard to get subject isolation in photographs until large aperture prime lenses become available.  I'm really excited about the future of this format.  Panasonic has promised a G1HD someone in the first half of this year (a G1 with video capabilities).  In addition, 3 new lenses have been announced:  a 7/14 f/4, a 14-140, and best of all a 20 mm f/1.7 pancake!  Olympus also showed off a concept of a micro43 camera that looked no bigger than a small point&shoot.  The future is exciting!
like	0	I have been a major Sookie Stackhouse fan for years.  I began reading Charlaine Harris's series, then called the Southern Vampire Mysteries, since before book four came out, and have read them all in order.  I was puzzled when I found out that HBO was going to make a TV adaptation of it.  Why this particular series?  Why not Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series?  (It would have been suitable, what with all of the sex and all.)  There were others as well, like Kelley Armstrong's Women of the Otherworld and MaryJanice Davidson's Queen Betsy series -- all of which have the erotic tones that HBO would have loved.  So why this book series?  Now I know why, but more on that later.  I very much enjoyed season one.  It was very faithful to Dead Until Dark, except that small characters like Tara and Lafayette were expanded, and you get everyone's point of view, not just Sookie's.  Also, Bill has more depth here, and you see things from his point of view, and you understand him better.  Other storylines were added, like the emphasis on "V" addiction, which makes sense.  Season two has taken things to a whole other level and I love it so far.  I can't wait for the blu-ray release!  From the very beginning, the show has very sexually explicit scenes, most of which centered on Jason's exploits, and some violence as well, with a great deal of emphasis to vampire hatred as the new form of southern racism/segregation.  Season two takes things further, with gore and horror replacing the sex (there's still plenty of it though), and the fledging out of characters like Eric, Tara and Lafayette (whose death does not happen in the TV series).   MaryAnn is the mysterious creature that makes a brief appearance in Living Dead in Dallas, but is expanded on the TV version to the point that she almost takes over the entire show.  Jessica, Bill's "daughter," puzzled me at first.  What's the purpose to this character?  But I like her now, especially after Hoyt becomes her love interest.  And I love the emphasis on vampire makers, like Lorena and Godric, the latter of whom moved me almost to tears in the last episode that he's in (plus, the actor who plays him is totally hot).  I don't want to ruin it for people who don't have HBO and have to wait for the DVD or blu-ray release, but, in spite of the departures from the books, it's better than season one.    The actors are great.  Ann Paquin has grown on me as Sookie, British hottie Stephen Moyer is wonderful as Bill, and I finally like Alexander Skarsgard as everyone's favorite vampire bad boy Eric.  I am also enjoying Sam Trammel (Sam Merlotte), Rutina Wesley (Tara), Nelsan Ellis (Lafayette), Michelle Forbes (MaryAnn Forester) and Ryan Kwatten (Jason Stackhouse).   I am also enjoying the actors who play Andy Belleflour and Hoyt for the comic relief they supply.  (Andy is hilarious as the drunken out-of-work cop who witnesses the orgies and general odd behavior and no one believes him.)  All in all, if you're a big fan of the books, then you won't want to miss this show.  No boring moments throughout the hour-long series.  I cannot wait for season three and season two is not even over yet!  And I see why HBO decided to adapt this particular book series.  They must've seen the potential for character development and the southern setting on the small screen.  Great job!

Visionary, perfectly executed and technically impeccable, Soundgarden set the standard for dark hard rock with this one.  I can't really think of a place to start in praising this album, but Chris Cornell's vocals are as good a place as any.  From the hushed tones of &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot; to the cathartic wailing of tunes like &quot;My Wave&quot; and the propulsive singing of &quot;Fourth of July,&quot; Cornell can simply do it all.  His dark, churning, guitar riffs, aided by Kim Thayil's soaring, distorted solos, complete the powerful atmosphere of these songs.  Add in Matt Cameron's nimble and inventive drumwork and the result is a musical masterpiece.  The variety of this album is also noteworthy, as it mixes hard rockers like the opening double shot of &quot;Let Me Drown&quot; and &quot;My Wave&quot; with slower, more melodic numbers like the hits &quot;Fell on Black Days&quot; and &quot;The Day I Tried To Live.&quot;  The megahit &quot;Black Hole Sun,&quot; while a strong song, is easily the worst track on the album, with the exception of the filler track &quot;Half.&quot;  &quot;Superunknown&quot; boasts all that serious music fans could possibly want, from creativity to technical precision to complex arrangements to a truly masterful and powerful overall vocal performance from Chris Cornell.  A masterpiece in every sense of the word.

The reservoir is plenty large, I actually fill it a second time for additional cleansing, usually adding a splash of Listerine.   It's recommended that you use luke-warm water, but for a real good time, I'll occasionally use cold water..give it a try! It's like an electric shock! .

Fast forward an amount of time (we are never told how much time has passed) and we find that our trio has parted ways. Kelly is now an in-demand Broadway star and Ozone and Turbo are back home volunteering at their community recreation center. Once again, Kelly tires of her life and heads back to the street to see Ozone and Turbo. Eventually, the three of them put together a dance show they hope will save the community center from being demolished to make room for a new shopping center.  "Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo" was released just 7 months after the first movie. Unfortunately, that short time span shows in this sequel.  Like the original "Breakin'" movie, "Electric Boogaloo" is full of 80s style dancing, mainly break dancing as well as poppin' and lockin'. And also like the original, this movie shines brightest when the focus is on the dancing.  Unfortunately for the movie, and for us, the plot line was expanded this time around. The writing has an awkward feel to it. Every time the dancing pulls you into the movie, the lines that are uttered pull you right back out. In addition, the increased plot highlights the acting inexperience of the stars.  If I was to base the rating for Breakin' 2 only on the plot, writing, and acting, it would only receive one-star. However, once again the dancing is the main star of the show. And if I was to base the rating only on the dancing, it would receive five-stars (it's really that good). So a good compromise is in order here, hence the three-star rating.

That being said, this is easy to do at work- I am able to pick it up and use it while I'm reading or doing other things that wouldn't require my hands. Like the commercial says the difference for this weight is that it is using small muscles unlike weight lifting that bulks up your arms. If you have trouble with neck or shoulders you may want to use caution with some of the exercises just like you would if you went to the gym. Doing an exercise you haven't done before should be done with caution and if not done properly could result in an injury. This would be unlikely with the shaker weight but in my opinion anything's possible. Also note-this does not shake on it's own- that is the point of this product that you use your muscles to make it shake. There are reviews on here that gave poor ratings because they thought it was motorized or something- well, I would say if you don't want to work out and actually use your muscles then you can save yourself $20 and do not buy this product:)  It is a great inventions and the science behind it makes sense. I have seen results and I recommend it to all my friends and coworkers.

This book had arrived a few days ago (ordered from the UK because it came out there first) and, each time I passed the table where it was sitting, I actually got a tingle just seeing the name Douglas Kennedy on the cover and knowing that something great was between those covers.   I like to think I discovered Douglas Kennedy all on my own many, many years ago when I read The Big Picture. At that time, whenever anyone asked me to recommend a great book, that's the one I told them to read. Kennedy followed up The Big Picture with The Job....another great roller coaster ride of a book. I don't know if something changed in his life at that point because all of the following books were very different. They were specifically about women or couples who were going through major rifts in their lives. As far as I'm concerned, no one can get inside of the head of a woman like Douglas Kennedy can. I wouldn't want to be his wife.   Kennedy writes that "All novels are about a crisis and how an individual -- or a set of individuals --negotiates said crises." In Leaving The World, the main character Joan Howard lives in the world of academia having gotten her PhD from Harvard and is now working as a professor at a New England college. I think Kennedy makes her so intellectually superior so that some of the things she does end up making her look more than intellectually challenged. Obviously doomed by her impulses, Jane finds herself mixed up in one predicament after another. It's how she deals with her crises that gives this book the depth that Kennedy's readers know he will deliver. She cannot stick to anything or anyone and finds herself lost in a world of people who continually leave her.   Until one day she decides that she will leave them. This is where Kennedy shines as he now puts Jane in charge of her own life and her own destiny and where we see shades of the excitement found in The Big Picture seeping through each page. While some people might say this book starts out slowly, they would be right because this is the way Kennedy sets the stage for things to come. He wants his reader to be totally invested in his character before he asks them to understand her. When we first meet Jane, it is in the present moment but, like everyone else, she has a back story and it's the understanding of this back story that will eventually help the reader to understand why she does what she does. In the book Kennedy says, "Life can only be lived forwards and understood backwards." And so we really come to understand more and more what is propelling Jane. There are times in the book where I was screaming, "NO Jane...don't do it", only to have my words fall on deaf ears.   Jane's life is one of ups and downs never seeming to find that happy medium between living and actually being happy doing so. Kennedy says in the book, "Unhappiness isn't simply a state of mind; it is also a habit." Reading this book is a journey as Jane tries to break this habit. It's another examination of the psyche of a woman by a master storyteller. In the hands of Douglas Kennedy, it becomes an expedition and one I was happy to take.   I know I've quoted Kennedy a lot in this review but some of the things he says in this book had such meaning to me. I leave you with one of the best...."Conscience is the inner voice which warns us that somebody might be looking." Well, I'm now your conscience looking at you and watching to see if you read this book!!!

like	0	Let me get this out of the way first.  And I have a feeling many of you will laugh when you read this.  But....I have never read the original story.  All I knew was some girl named Alice fell down a hole and met a bunch of strange characters and that's about it.  Honestly?  I think that gave me an advantage to actually watch the film without expecting things to go a certain way.  I know a lot of critics are saying this version is too much like "Lord of the Rings".  I can't say if that's accurate or not but the ending hardly reminded me of anything out of "Lord of the Rings".  I was scared, I mean REALLY scared that Burton, even with Depp and the rest of the cast wouldn't be able to pull this off.  I was scared right in the beginning that the film would rapidly dissolve into something so bad and so corny it would be painful to watch.  It didn't.  In a sea of weird movies, this one has to be Burton's crowing jewel of weirdness.  If you thought "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was weird, you haven't seen ANYTHING.  This movie ups the weirdness factor by 100.  Is that a good thing?  It depends.....  Did you like "Charlie"? If the answer is yes, than you'll probably like this.  I liked "Charlie" but I though this was a hundred times weirder and better.   Ok...."Alice in Wonderland".  What was good?  Masterfull acting from Depp, Carter, and Hathaway.  Burton's most visually stunning movie ever.  Great score.  The film was paced well and wasn't a second too long or too short.  I know a lot of people were worried that the CGI would ruin the movie. It didn't, it blends seamlessly with the human actors into a film quite like no other. Some may say Avatar, but I haven't seen that yet so I really can't compare.   What was bad?  There really wasn't a whole lot of story to be had here.  It had A story just not a very deep one.  What little story was there was good and it wrapped up very nicely.  I'm knocking one star off due to lack of a more in depth story.  But considering I never knew what the original story was to begin with I really can't complain.   Let's sum it up.  Burton's most visually stunning film ever.  The entire cast is amazingly good.  Everything is perfect in every way except the story could have used a little more work.  I saw the movie in 2D not 3D but I loved the 2D version. I may or may not go see it again in 3D but I'm anxious to read what others say about the 3D version.  All in all,  "Alice in Wonderland" comes....  Highly Recommended!!!

Because they contain aloe, they're good for my hands, too, which helps because new moms are constantly washing their hands.  I haven't found any place other than Amazon where they're cheaper - Amazon is the place to buy them.  I've also purchased a case of the travel size wipes for the diaper bag - they're perfect.  I was actually given a case of huggies wipes at my baby shower and haven't used them because I like the Seventh Generation ones better.  What could be better than a product that really works well and is better for the planet than the other choices out there?  I won't change brands after finding these!

Passport likes to put their logo in the corner of the screen and finds just about the worst quality they can possibly dig up. This DVD has jumps in the film and couldn't get too much more grainy looking.  This is the second time I've been burned by Passport video. The first time being their DVD of Plan 9 From Outer Space which suffers the same fate. If I had noticed this one was released by Passport I wouldn't have bought it but I didn't even check. Shame on me and shame on Passport for releasing such garbage. Stay away from their releases at all costs.  As for the film itself, see the review below.

It made many people sad all over the world and it seems that for once everyone was being nice to this man who had always been abused by the Medias; journalists, interviewers and others. When I heard of the "This Is It" movie concert I didn't know what to think. I knew it was rehearsal footage from the 50 concerts he was to perform at the O2 arena but I didn't know what was going to come out of it or what they were going to do with it. When I saw the trailers I knew I had to see this and that "This Is It" was going to be something special like I've never seen. And that's precisely what I got, I even bought my ticket in advance for the movie and feel like it was much worth it.  It amazed me how good MJ still was, the dance moves were great and fascinating to me. He was clearly the one in charge of the whole thing. He gave precise instructions of what he wanted, made sure everything was right and did everything that needed to be done. The film shows just how much Michael was respected, there were parts of it where they asked him if he wanted anything or what he thought and if he liked something, it seems no one assumed anything at all. When he talked the crew would listen and he asked things in the nicest way, never to hurt anyone. There's not a part that doesn't make him look like the nice guy he always was. There are mixed feelings about him after all the bad things that have been said about him but after watching this I don't know one could possibly believe them.  To be honest I loved every minute of it, every song was special and was great to watch. Right from the beginning of "Wanna Be Startin'Somethin'" it was amazing. No matter how many people surround him he's always the one who does things better than anyone else and the one you're watching. This Is It was really a unique experience, I felt they chose the right footage parts for the movie and made him look great in every sense. They could truly have messed things up but they didn't and came out with an amazing documentary, it's sort of a testament to his fans, it's just very special. I really liked the Thriller 3D part, it was a 3D video shoot and afterwards you see MJ coming out onstage from a spider, the show would have looked awesome. They Don't Care About Us was amazing, The Smooth Criminal part was very interesting, so was the Earth Song which had a beautiful video of a little girl in a forest, waking up to see that all of it has been destroyed. I won't go further but every song had something about them.   The stage show would have been grandiose, the fireworks, the "fireball" (quite impressive I won't spoil anything), pyrotechnics, the videos that accompany the songs are all very impressive. This could very well have been the best show ever had he lived to perform them. In the end I was quite amazed by the 1: 48 minutes I watched, I can't wait to see it again and the message Michael gives at the end is very inspiring. From the auditions of the brilliant performers to the credits with the "This Is It" song I was captivated.  The said special features will feature more of the rehearsal and a two part documentary on Michael's history and his comeback along behind the scenes. I can't wait to see more of the rehearsal and hopefully the extras will be great and there will plenty to watch.  It's hard for me to describe what watching this movie was like and what I felt about it. I know this is rehearsal footage but it's truly brilliant and while it main not catch Michael at his best it certainly catches him at his most honest. I don't have anything bad to say about either this movie or the man himself, This Is It is a must see. It doesn't matter if you watch in its theatrical run or on DVD/Blue Ray when released, this is amazing and his fans just have to see this. I will certainly be amongst those who buy it and watch it over and over again. This man gave his life to music and his fans and I don't remember where I heard or read this but I do remember that someone said: "He was a gift of god, he was a kind human being who's been mistreated by many opportunists, he's been taken advantage of but he was the nicest person and could never harm anyone" or sometime like that. These words are very truthful and really mean something to his fans.

After reading the mostly good reviews written for it (both the black version as well as this in white), I decided to take a chance and order it without first seeing it "in person." It arrived within two days, and it was terrifically simple to set up. I have obviously been living in the dark ages with the small 9" kitchen TV it replaced. It's a perfect size for the table top, the color and sound are superior to the old one, the various features and options are fabulous to now have in the kitchen -- a variety of picture sizes, shapes, and modes (yes, "movie" seems the best) and even the DVD option will be useful too I bet. I like the wide screen and size in general for this small spot, and it should all look even better when they switch everything over to digital within the month and I get my adapter box. I agree, there is a few second's delay when switching channels, but that seems to be the only fault I can find and it's pretty minor to me. The red light is no problem at all and a tiny light in the kitchen at night isn't a bad thing! This has been a really pleasant surprise!

The poster art in this book reminded me of the genuine heartfelt effort put into handicrafts some friends and lovers give each other, especially early on in a relationship.  Those who appreciate cuteness and whimsy will enjoy this book.  This is a great comforting book to give to a friend, relative, or signifcant other particularly when they are sick, feeling down, and/or adapting to a stressful situation.

The biggest plus about this system is that I can hook up my Xbox (RCA hook up or digital). Keep in mind that If you hook it up with RCA you can't get surround, but the stereo sounds amazing. I was afraid of Coby from all bad reviews on other systems. This one really exceeded every expectations. Very clear sound, great price and a great DVD player make this perfect. I'm 21 and live in an apartment so the rooms aren't that big. I have a 100 sq. foot living room. This system is just right. When you finish setting it up (took me about 30 min, running cables and all) you need to put in a DVD like Lord of the Rings to test out the sound. If you leave everything at the default you'll notice that there's almost no bass and the center speaker is WAY over powering. Play around with your setting for a while, you CAN get bass out of it, just look through the menus.

The author writes in a style I can best describe as clear and powerful:  he does not get bogged down in over-explanation of facts, and the unfolding events leading up to Secretary Brown's death read like a gripping suspense novel...except these events are well-documented NON-fiction.  The author's exhaustive research and hours of interviews with the people in Ron Brown's world are thoroughly documented.  As I read what had happened in the years prior to his death, I made my own connections and theories.  The author, Mr. Cashill, did not preach, and did not press theories and proposed scenarios as truth.  Mr. Cashill respects the reader...respects the reader's intelligence and deduction skills.  I must highly recommend this book:  you will not be bored, you will find it hard to put down, you will learn a lot, what you already know will be reinforced, and you will want to talk to others about it.

I also found that it got boring to do because you are suppose to do it often but its the same thing every time.  By the time I stopped doing it I was sick of the music in it, sick of the exercises and the order they went in.  But even so, it is a great tape that does show you some good techniques and moves but if you like variety and tire quickly like me I don't reccommend this tape for you.
like	0	This is one of those rare books that makes me realize how grateful I am that I enjoy reading and am given the gift of being able to slip into someone else's story and experience what they do through the written word.  As other reviewers have noted: this is the story of a young woman who discovers that she can taste other people's deepest emotions and secrets through the food that they prepare. It changes her perspective on the world and while there is no "revolution of action" for her (meaning she doesn't harness the power to make a global impact or anything quite as grand) her perceptions and reactions are honest and breathtaking.  I'm not a huge fan of "magic realism" books because I find they tend to tilt towards overblown fairy-tale instead of moments of enchantment which enrich the story, but "The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake" is a perfect balance. Even the strange story of Rose's brother adds to the story, although there was a chapter I had to read several times to wrap my brain around.  While I do recommend this book, it's NOT for people who find untraditional narrative unappealing. For instance, there is not a *single* quotation mark in the entire book. There is little deliniation between throught and spoken word/conversation. At first, I thought "I can't read this..." but within a page or two, I fell right into Rose's perspective and the book just flowed.  I really loved reading this book. While there were sad moments, I never once felt like chucking the book across the room, which I get the urge to do when other books get overwhelmingly depressing (usually for the sake of packing an emotional punch). "The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake" kept me enchanted and locked in its story until the last page. And then I insisted my husband read it, which I rarely do.   Great book.

It was packed very well, but the strings that came with it were awful - they are difficult (if not impossible) to tune correctly, and they were very corroded when I received it.  The solution was very simple - I bought a new set of strings for a regular guitar. Instead of tuning it like a standard guitar, tune it a fourth or a major third above standard tuning. This is perfect for the size of the guitar, and it sounds great. Remember to use very low gauge strings.

Bic calls these pens "medium point" but the ink is quite clear on the page. The blue ink lasts for months--unless you write a lot with these every day in which case they will last a shorter amount of time.   The pens are compact and easy to carry with you; this makes them easy to carry because they are so lightweight. The pens are made of plastic with a see through ink tube inside them. The advantage of the see through ink tube is that you can tell when the pen is running low on ink--a great feature!   As nerdy as it sounds, gentlemen can easily carry one or two in their shirt pockets. I would keep the cap on, of course.   Actually, I would keep the cap on at all times when not using this pen. The ink still inside the pen can dry out rather quickly without the cap being on them. Moreover, you don't want ink to leak out of the pen and make nasty ink stains.   Overall, if you want an inexpensive pen that still gives you high quality writing ink, you can't go wrong with these pens by Bic. I have used them for decades with great satisfaction.   I highly recommend these pens for anyone wanting an inexpensive but good quality blue ink pen.

The only thing that I would have loved in this TV was to have the Samsung Internet@TV feature, where I could directly watch You Tube videos, Netflix etc, but this TV does not have this feature, unlike some other high-end Samsung HDTVs. That was dissapointing. I wish I had spend a couple of hundered dollars more and got a model with Internet@TV feature.  But, you can still hook up this TV to your wireless router at home and stream videos and pictures from your PC/Laptop wirelessly.  Also, the sound quality is not so good. That is because the speakers are located in the rear.  I am planning to buy the Samsung Blue-Ray 5.1 channel home theatre system with the Internet@TV feature, and that would take care of everything that is lacking in this TV that I would like to have.  If you are not looking for advanced features, but a very good reliable TV with great picture quality, this is a very good buy for the money.

Once you get used to using iTunes (yeah, you have to), it is quite easy to set up your music any which way you want. It is quite simple to build playlists by album, genre, or artists. I have been listening to some of my music I had not heard in a long time. And if you use the shuffle feature, you will never get bored, it becomes like a "box of chocolate"; you never know what you are going to get. Very satisfied with this product.

I think that was a great price after having spent $400.00 on the Vita Mix which in my opinion is old technology compared to the Ninja.   The Ninja really does perform great!! I would recommend this product to anyone who uses it for mixed drinks, sorbets and smoothies.  The double blade technology is a great inventions!!

It is in standard format, but when I set my TV to panorama mode, the picture looked almost like wide-screen format. So, if your TV supports panorama mode, you shouldn't be concerned with the standard format of the DVD. Picture looks dark and dull in many places, but it is acceptable, though.  It has 4 chapters, Aquarium 1, 2, 3 and Bonus. They are all equally good. It also has two sound tracks - they call them aquatic and ambient.  Overall, my rating is high due to the price it is selling for.

Smell was my biggest worry when I ran across this book. I know only too well how stinky my wet dogs can be, but apparently they say the smell can be washed out quite permanently and easily and then they ask if one has ever smelled a sheep up close.  Good point!  With smell issues out of the way, I read on with interest.  Instead of throwing away all of that lovely golden fur floating around my home, I might actually be able to use it.  Of course this involves quite a bit of work.  Daily brushings, the labor intensive washing, washing and washing again of the fuzz (without clogging your drain in the process), then one must card (comb)the fuzz so it all lays the way it should, then you've got to oil it, spin it (an art in itself) and ply it into yarn.  Yikes, it looks so easy when laid out in a few pages in a book but it sounds too much like work for someone like me.    After you've done all of the above, if you're one of those inexhaustible types, you can knit hats, scarves and just about anything that you'd knit with wool.  The projects seem pretty straightforward but the instructions assume one has some familiarity with knitting.  There are scarves, hats, mittens sweaters, even a doggie sweater (the pic shows a pug smugly wearing a  sweater made from newfoundland fur, way too cute!).  You must know the basic stitches, know all about knitting the round, know how to use your double pointed and circular needles and how to work fair isle/intarsia if you want to finish many of these items.  I would've appreciated a little knitting 101 section here (especially for the color work, are you supposed to purl or knit the colors??), but that's just me and I suppose that stuff can easily be found on google but still . . .  The other downside of this book are the black and white photos.  The items are described as beautiful tones of "golden retriever fur" or whatever and then they show a grainy b&w photo of a fuzzy looking scarf which was so disappointing.  There also are not nearly enough photos showing how to make and use the drop spindle (though the carding section was well illustrated and appears simple enough).  I seriously doubt I could learn the art of spinning dog fuzz using only this book and will look for a video if I ever get my fuzzies washed and ready (I think this part intimidates me the most!).  There is a section outlining breeds and their "spinability" for those on the lookout for fuzz machines.  Lucky for me, my two goldens are top producers but my lab is a poor choice.  Apparently, though, his "short chocolate sprinkles" can be added to all of the glamorously soft golden fur to spice up the color.  Who knew?  This was an informative, very niche book, that takes its topic seriously and was a fun read.  It's got me looking at the fuzz balls in a new way but I'm not sure if I'll ever work up the energy to collect, wash, card, and then spin this stuff into workable yarn because I'm just too lazy.  Though it might make a nice little side business for someone with a lot of time to spare.  Imagine a keepsake of your beloved pet like no other.  The possibilities are endless . . .

Good bits: -The system is about as easy as it could be. -The instructions are clear and simple. -The fermenting tank is small (2 gallons), meaning that you don't have to wait around for a long time to taste the final product. With your more normal 5 gallon kits, you have to bottle a LOT of beer, and wait a bit longer for fermentation. -There's dozens of mixes available on their homepage, and they offer a lot of quality products at reasonable prices. Join their club to avoid the expensive shipping charges.  Not so good bits: -The fermenter is almost too simple. A proper airlock design would make it more foolproof as to tell when fermenting is complete, as well as avoiding contamination of the beer. -The included mixes, while of good quality, produce a rather poor beer by comparison to what it is possible to make with the kit. Their website has a lot better product than what they include in the kit, and this gives some people bad impressions of the kit itself. The fault is not with the kit, but with the very basic starter beer in the package. The separate mixes they sell in stores are not much better, being all very basic brews. They're not bad, but they're not great either. Mediocre at best. -Sterilization (which is possibly the most important part of home brewing) is difficult because the fermenter is not dishwasher safe. A higher quality plastic that could stand high temperatures would be a better overall choice for the fermenting keg, since automatic dishwashers are a great way to sterilize your equipment easily.  My suggestions on how to use this kit correctly: -Go to their website and pick up some of the more advanced receipes instead of using the mixes as given initially. If you've used those included mixes, don't be disappointed overall, it's that the mixes are very basic. Using the better receipes and the better ingredients, you can make quite incredible brews. -Keep the fermenter in an enclosed dark space during the fermenting process. I recommend a large cooler. This avoids contamination of the product as well as keeping it at a steady temparature. -Be very, very careful to sterilize completely. The OneStep cleanser they include is very good, but you do have to use it properly. Read the instructions and be sure that everything gets cleaned extremely well. -No matter what the instructions say, bottle conditioning takes longer than a week. Really. Wait 2 weeks, preferably 4, before you crack the first bottle. The beer only gets better the longer you let it mature in the bottles. -Go easy on the sugar. Too much sugar in the bottles and they will explode, or taste like cider.  If you use the kit as intended and with a careful eye for cleanliness, then you can produce some excellent quality brews in a very short time. But follow those instructions precisely. Anything less will result in poor quality brews.  ---- After using it for over a year, I have some more things to add:  - DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN THE LID. The lid must allow the gases produced MUST escape. This is especially true with their higher alcohol mixes and stouts. If you overtighten, the end result will be spilled beer and a ruined keg. I brewed a dopplebock using the keg, and overtightened it. Result: The keg overpressurized and almost burst. Some foam came out of the top of the keg, and spilled into my cooler. The residue, once it dried, provided food for.. well.. not so nice creatures. The keg was naturally unusable afterwards. However, this was my own fault, and a new keg only cost me $10 through the Mr. Beer website, so it was not a total loss. And the beer (since it was not contaminated due to the pressure differential, I bottled it anyway) turned out to be absolutely spectacular. So whatever you do, don't tighten it too much. A little hand pressure for tightening is enough.  - Again, go easy on the sugar when bottling! Somebody told me that they had one of the plastic bottles burst on them and the remainder tasted like cider. This is the result of excessive sugar in the bottling process. I highly recommend you get the sugar measure that they sell, if you are bottling in the 12oz, 22oz, or 1 liter sizes. The sugar measure is very easy to use and exact in nature. Takes out the measurements and guesswork.  - Finally, I do not recommend normal bottles with a capper. These are difficult to use and contrary to popular belief, do not produce better beer. The screw top bottles are simplest because they hold the pressure in properly and are trivially simple to use. Alternatively, Mr. Beer sells 16 oz "Grolsch style" bottles on their site, which are the rubber grommeted wired cappers, and they work very well. If you must bottle with glass, get those. Or go find similarly capped bottles of beer and use those bottles (after dishwashing, of course). Glass is much easier to sterilize because it's disahwasher safe. Just take the rubber caps off first.

I needed something with large capacity and relatively fast file transfer time.  PROS:  It shares the largest SD capacity on the market today with few others (Panasonic, Sandisk, and PNY) and is a quality name that I have had a good history with in the past. Its file transfer time is similar to the SSD drive in my machine so it basically acts as a second SSD for me at less than a quarter of the price!  CONS:   Its not the cheapest 32gb SD card(PNY) nor the fastest(Panasonic) but its good quality with a decent transfer rate.  CONCLUSION:  I'm very happy with its performance and capacity. I would like to see the price come down a bit, but that's the price of getting electronics of this caliber.  That's my input, take it or leave it :)

I cannot speak to the bugs that others seem to be experiencing. In my 70 hours I have had my game freeze only a handful of times, and none of them were anything that was game breaking. I have several friends who are also playing and none of them have expressed any serious glitches either.  I have played both the previous Fallout games and vastly enjoyed them both, so to make a blanket statement that "anyone who was a fan of the first 2 Fallouts will hate this game" is just erroneous. I would agree with someone who said this game is more of a Next Gen title in the Fallout Universe rather than a true sequel to the Interplay games.   However, that does not in any way detract from the epic amount of fun to be found in Fallout 3.   The adventuring around the Wastes is the highlight of the game to be sure. The amazing amount of freedom to roam the Wastes is just phenomenal, so much so that once you do decide to progress the Main Story it can seem very limiting and cramped at times, especially when crawling around through the DC Ruins and all the subway tunnels required to get to  the Main Mall.   However, compared to the vast scope and size of the experience, this is a minor complaint and really a very short and small portion of the game. It should only take maybe 5 hours to explore it all and finish up some questing, then you can Fast Travel back whenever you want and get back to tearing it up in the Wastes.   Combat is quality, but it is NOT a Shooter. People expecting Shooter mechanics will be disappointed, as even point blank shooting still utilizes an in game Dice Roll to determine whether you hit and how much damage you do etc.   It is likely that people complaining about Ammo or clunky targeting are unaware of this game mechanic, but it is what makes the game an RPG, not a Shooter. There is ample amounts of Ammo (I have never run out in 70 hours of gameplay and I have killed over 1000 living -isms according to my in game stat sheet), but it is not unlimited like a Shooter.   The VATS mode is a good way to illustrate the difference. You queue up VATS and it will give you a stop-time targeting system. Within this system, you will be given percentages to hit on various Body parts: 87% to hit the head, 95% to hit the Body etc. However, these percentages are also indicative of how much of a chance you would have to hit those body parts OUT of VATS as well. So if you have a 50% chance to hit a leg in VATS, you have that SAME chance to hit in real-time it just does not illustrate it anywhere. SO even if your targeting arrow is Red, you still only have the same percentage to hit as you would in VATS. Which is to say you will miss and waste a ton of ammo if you just think "my target is red I can unload a clip".   Dice Rolls are a staple of RPGS, Oblivion had them, it was just not as noticeable because you were using Melee weapons, but every time your guy reared back to swing it rolled the dice to see if you would hit, how much of a damaging blow it would be etc.  The game has a wide array of voice acting, some is great, some not so much. The story has its ups and downs, but is good enough to not take away from the overall (it certainly helps that the great Liam Neeson is the Vault Dweller's Father, he is an example of the Great voice acting). Various mini-quests are actually more entertaining and interesting than the main story, so there is definitely enough Good story in the game to keep it interesting.   However, the game's strength is in solo-adventuring IMO. While you can get sidekicks and helpers, the real fun is being a Hero of the Wastes and taking down Super-Mutants, Raiders, Slavers and Death Claws all by your lonesome as you scour the Wastes in search of unique weapons, caps, ammo and mini-quests littered throughout.   Overall, I would rate the game a 9/10 and consider it the only game on Xbox 360 that gives Mass Effect a challenge for best title.

The blu-ray disc, the photos, and the soundtrack are awesome, however, the jewelry box is made out of cardboard and the bookmark is nothing special.  The bookmark just says Twilight on it.  I have seen better bookmarks on other websites sold separately.  The bracelet is decent.  The watch looks like a kids watch that you can purchase out of a gumball machine.  I am mostly just happy to have the dvd, but for $80, I was expecting the quality of the other items to be much, much better than they were.  Overall, it probably would have been better to buy the blu-ray disc separately and then shop around at other websites, like Etsy.com, for the other items made from better material.
like	0	This book, nearly 800 pages, analyzes in exhaustive detail Ken Starr's investigation as independent prosecutor of President Clinton.   Two things stand out about this book.   First, the colossal amount of research that went into it. Gormley interviewed not only all the major players in the events, including Starr, Clinton, and Monica Lewinsky, but also hosts of minor characters, relatives, attorneys, and the like. I have rarely read any book on any subject that interviewed so many different people in so much depth, many of them ordinarily difficult to find.   Gormley's extreme diligence pays off as he uncovers tragic but mesmerizing details that are not widely known. For example, he has a detailed account of Jim McDougal's death in solitary confinement including information based on his interviews with McDougal's prison psychologist. He also uncovered a report highly critical of the prosecutors' interrogation of Monica Lewinsky, which criticizes the prosecutors for continuing to question her after she had requested an attorney. What was particularly interesting is that the report was never released because, allegedly, its release would have violated the privacy, not of Lewinsky - but of her prosecutors! One of the most interesting features of this book is that while the FBI was devoting enormous investigative resources to the question of whether the president committed perjury in his Jones deposition, Clinton was sending missiles against al-Qaeda threats in Afghanistan. Some of the participants expressed exasperation that law enforcement did not consider anti-terrorism investigation a higher priority than the Jones deposition issues.  The second great thing about this book is that it's so clear and easy to read. Although it covers events over twenty years, innumerable legal proceedings and lawsuits, it's paced so that it's nearly impossible to put down. It's one thing to collect all this information, but the author also managed to have it tell an incredible tale: at times tragic, at times infuriating, at times laughable - but always fascinating.  Nevertheless, the book had a few weaknesses.  One omission generally was that the details of the legal arguments tended to be glossed over.  For example, there is no analysis of Clinton's arguments that he did not commit perjury in his testimony in the Paula Jones deposition, which are important to understand the merits of his defense. In general, the author sometimes appears to conflate similar terms for specific acts in ways the confuse the issue about perjury.   As the legal discussion, on page 172 the author describes a bill that would allow certain private litigants to sue sitting presidents as one that would "almost certainly have violated the U.S. Constitution's command against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws." This statement seems too strong. Ex post facto laws do not ordinarily circumscribe civil liability, and a bill as described could probably be drafted so as to withstand a bill of attainder challenge.   I would also have wanted to read a more detailed analysis of the legal arguments of Clinton v. Jones or Morrison v. Olson, the two key cases that led to the scandal. Interestingly, the author does include an interview with a Supreme Court justice defending the claim in Clinton v. Jones that allowing a private lawsuit against a sitting president would be unlikely to be distracting. Although the author suggests at one point that Justice Scalia supported the independent counsel, it would have been interesting to note that Scalia was the lone dissent in Morrison v. Olson, the case authorizing the law. Indeed, Scalia predicted, in his dissent in Morrison v. Olson, that the independent counsel law would gravely damage the republic because it violated the separation of powers.   The writing itself is excellent. It's clear, well-paced, and hard to put down. Still, there were some issues in the way of copy editing. On pages 88 and 554 the author misuses "bold-faced" in the phrases "bold-faced liar" and "bold-faced deception". Even if this unfortunate usage has been sanctioned by popularity, it's still better to use "bald-faced" instead. The author similarly misuses "fulsome" to mean "full" on pages 135 and 567 ("draft a more fulsome four-count complaint"; "Starr had taken in compiling a fulsome report.").   Some readers may find that portions of the book take a more supportive view of the independent counsel than the narrative suggests, but since the narrative contains the facts for the reader, the treatment cannot be said to be unfair.  In conclusion the book is well-written, well-researched and interesting. It's a superb example of journalism and an important contribution to the literature.

They are cheap and effective. Same thing about not being able to pick up a quarter off the ground.  That takes me a couple tries with my bare hands. If you want gloves that are by themselves comfortable at all times and in all weather, really durable, maximum protection, dexterity feels better than your bare hands, etc., then you're gonna have to spend $300.00.  (btw, if you own $300 gloves and aren't some kind of professional racer or a retired millionaire out with your wife on a six month Goldwing tour of the US, you're just a sucker.  And if you are one of those two, you're awesome). I do apreciate the comments about them running small.  I got one size up from my usual and they're just a little big.  Really they're just perfect b/c I like to put a pair of $1 knit gloves underneath for weather versatility during the day. The gloves were a little itchy when I first wore them (without my 2nd pair), but that quickly wore off.  With the gloves under, they're SUPER comfortable.  The grip is perfect.  Also love the big knuckle pads.  I get hit with more rocks to my hands than you would believe. All-in-all, for $15 this is a great pair of gloves.

I want a good story.  Sometimes, Patterson's formula works and sometimes it doesn't.  I enjoy The Women's Murder Club series and the Alex Cross series (though I must admit, I'm behind on both series.)   So far I've enjoyed the books written with (or some might say by) Maxine Paetro.  I found Private to be a good story.  At first I was a little distracted by the different mysteries going on at the same time.  However, once it occurred to me that a detective agency the size of Private would be involved with multiple cases, I found that I rather liked the bouncing between the cases.  Private is a quick read.  I found it to be a good example of what I think goes on in a large detective agency.  I could be wrong, but who cares. I enjoyed the book and there are really only two reasons for reading a book - entertainment and/or information.  Will this book win any awards? Probably not.  Do I feel as though I wasted my time reading it? No.  If you want a quick read, this is the book for you.  If you care more about how the book is written than the end result, then find another book and another author.

So here's the long story. Grab a cup of coffee, as this review answers questions you never knew existed.  I have to admit that there have been few items that have captured and kept my enthusiasm for as long as the iPod Touch. Two years ago, I purchased the original Touch, last year I upgraded to the 32 GB, and now I have the 64GB version. Was the upgrade worth it? And what are the things yet to be imroved? Because even though the Touch is close to perfection, there are still many small things that can be improved.  Hardware Physically, the new (64GB) Touch is identical to it's 2nd generation brethren. It's polished crome backplate is slightly curved, making it fit your palm perfectly. As before, the fact that it's made from polished chrome will guarantee that it attracts fingerprints and scratches almost magically. I'm no friend of any kind of protective covers, and my last (32GB) Touch had to live in my pocket with my keys, coins, and other stuff I threw in with it. After a year, the backplate did pick up a lot of scratches, and I expect that the 64GB to fare no better. Personally, I would have preferred a brushed finish for the backplate. This may have caused problems with the readability of the customized engraving that Apple applies to the Touch on the backplate for no additional charge (a nice 'touch' that becomes increasingly important as the Touch becomes more ubiquitious). This custom engraving you can only get if you order the Touch through Apple (it's also not available in the Apple Stores).  The front plate is made from one of the most impressive glass enhancements I've ever seen. After a year of heavy abuse, my old Touch's glass front has not a single scratch - not one. I don't know how Apple does it, but this is really impressive. Remember, I don't use any protective covers or films. The screen itself is brilliant, bright, and can easily be read outside, wich is a feat in itself. The Touch has an ambient light sensor, so it can dim the screen when the surroundings are darker.  This time around, the screen's color temperature has remained unchanged (the 2G shifted all colors from a blueish to a more golden tinge). Movie playback is simply astonishing. The image is crisp, and the on-screen controls natural. Again, there are niceties such as double-tapping the screen to change aspect ratio, or placing bookmarks etc. You still can't set a movie's contrast, but beyond that small issue, movie playback is perfect. Viewing movies on the Touch simply works great, but personally I think that the screen is too small to watch a full movie. Last week, I tried watching a TV episode while on a plane enroute to Hamburg (a 75 minute flight), but quickly decided against it, opting instead to play a game of 'Luxor'. Somehow I prefer a larger screen for consuming video, while I have no problems doing something interactive on it. Still, video plays great on the Touch.  Button and interface lay-out has remained the same from the last generation: volume controls on the left side, top holds the 'exit/on' button, buttom has dock and phones connectors, and the front holds the single home button. There is one thing that can be improved here: I would have preferred the audio connector to be on top (or either side), as the current configuration precludes the use of many applications (e.g. News- and eBook readers) when you want to place it upright -- for example in the Gym. Some apps do use the accelerometers and can be used positioning the Touch upside down, though.   The built-in speaker is unchanged from the last version. It's weak, tinny, mono, produces horrible sound, has no volume to speak of -- and yet it's one of the best additions to the Touch (the original didn't have it, the 2nd gen did). It simply makes casual gaming so much more fun. I don't care about the bad sound quality, I just love the fact that it's there.   The signatory white earphones that Apple sells with the Touch may look good, but I don't like them. In my ears they are too uncomfortable. Since I'm no audiophile, I can't comment on their audio quality other than that it's good enough for me. Anyway, I replaced them with my favorite non-Apple version. The hitch here is that Apple now delivers the 64 GB (and 32 GB) with earphones that sport a built-in mic and remote. And my head phones don't have that. While the remote is nothing much to write home about (the way it works is just too complex), the mic works well, and has just the right fidelity to pick out voice over the background noise. So, for now, I keep the white buds with me in case I want to use the IP-telephony capabilities.  Battery life appears to have been reduced somewhat from the 2nd gen - at least on paper. During the past few days the new 3rd gen Touch certainly performed as well as or even better than my 2nd gen - but then again, that one's battery is already one year old. One fact that I've become very fond of is the quick-charge ability, which works really well.  The built-in wireless connectivity is really nice, with astonishingly well executed integration. The touch does all it's wireless networking over WiFi and Bluetooth. WiFi works really well (especially here in Switzerland where Hotspots are particularely dense), and Bluetooth integration (which I tried on the 3rd gen for the first time) is flawless. WiFi reception (range) lags somewhat behind that of a Wintel laptop (no doubt due to the metal backplate) and is pretty much on par with that of a 15" Macbook Pro (which is also somewhat lacking in WiFi reception range). WiFi is still the 'g' variant though [interestingly enough, the built-in hardware does support 11n, but so far Apple has chosen not to activate it, presumably to conserve battery. This is interesting also from the fact that in the 2G Touch, Apple initially included Bluetooth capabilities, but only activated it with a later OS release. Perhaps the same can be expected for 11n]. Bluetooth now also works with headphones and BT-based car integration kits (works well in mine). I would have loved to try out BT-based printing from the Calender or Addressbook app, but hit a snag: it appears no Touch app supports printing...  Missing Hardware There is some hardware that I expected, or whished that it was included in the Touch - especially as (some) of them are now present on other iPods: No camera. I was somewhat ambivalent about this. No camera means no pictures and/or movies. But it also means that I can keep handling it rough, as I do not have to worry abou the lens. Also, I don't have to worry about taking it to the Gym (my Gym has very strict rules towards camera-equipped items). All things being equal, the addition of a camera (still and/or video) would have been nice, but I don't miss it much (truth be told, I yet have to use the camera on my mobile phone). Unfortunately, there is also no built-in mic. This is much a more significant omission than having no camera. The Touch is a first class audio voice recorder and (more importantly for me) a first class Skype client. There are third party solutions for this (a mini-micro that directly plugs into the headphone connector), but if the touch had a built-in mike, it would make using world-class applications like Shazam (and Skype) so much easier Likewise, there is no compass, nor a GPS receiver present in the touch. I understand that these are left out to better differentiate the Touch from the iPhone, but I would have welcomed them in the top-of-the-line (64GB) version of the iPod.   And, finally, there is no radio receiver. I'm definitely not a radio man, as I next to never listen to it. Still, some people do (as the ton of nicely selling IP radio applications shows), and anyway, the Nano has it now - even with a nice Tivoesque pause feature! Why not the Touch? Strange design choice.   iPod & iTunes The original iPod's strength was the sheer brilliant ease of use - and the touch-based interface represented a mile-stone in improving on that. To date there simply is no better multimedia interface than that of the Touch/iPhone. It's natural after just a few seconds. It's drop-dead beautiful, with muted highlights, and cleverly accentuated by small (if flashy) animations that convey the different metaphors of the interface (e.g. the rubber-banded bouncing when you reach the end of a playlist). Like no interface before you can instantly use it to accomplish even complex tasks with just the flick of a finger. Using it is sheer, unadulterated fun. The 'Coverflow' album browsing may be one of the least useful, but it's definitely the most natural (and fun) way to flip though you music. And it is jaw-droppingly well executed (note: when you use coverflow you should make sure that you have installed the all cover art from any music you did not purchase from the iTunes Store).   At the base of all iPod music playing is the Playlist, and using playlist on the Touch is a joy. The interface whileplaying is also mature, offering niceties such as displaying a song's lyrics on a single tap, along with singularily simple controls for repeat and shuffle play. Unfortunately, this playlist feature also still has one of the most glaring shortcomings: the Touch is unable to play playlist groups. I usually group a small bunch of songs into very short playlist (e.g. '10 best Springsteen'), and then mix these playlist into larger ones by simply dropping a playlist into a group. Although iTunes supports this, all versions of the Touch have stubbornly refused to do that. Also somewhat strangely missing on the Touch is the ability to search for an Artist or music title. Considering the fact that more than 10'000 songs fit onto the device the need for an ability to search for something would seem obvious (note: the Touch *does* have a global search function, which will also turn up songs - along with contacts and mails that match your search phrase. Having to leave the iPod app simply to look for a song is against everything Apple's ease of use is about, and it's not what I would expect). And while we are at it, I'd love the ability to also search the lyrics, but that would be the icing on the cake. What is present, and what continues to amaze me is a function that I initially dismissed as some way to sell song: Genius Playlists. What it does is that given a song it finds other songs you already possess that would play nicely together. Since I have lots of songs (else I wouldn't be purchasing the 64GB), this feature has helped me to get an incredible amount of additional joy out of my music. There are lots of gems hidden that mass of music I never knew I owned. Of course, if you want to, Genius will also recommend songs you don't have but can buy right now on iTunes. That, of course, is the 'sell song' angle. But at least it's incredibly well executed (and yes, I've used it)  The 64GB now also supports voice recognition - and I'm sure it's a marvel of technology. But (much like the auto-correction system for text) it mostly only works in English. If you have set your system to German, you must pronounce english band names as they would be read aloud by a german-only speaker. Do it once, and everyone in the room stares at you. You'll never do it again. Plus, due to the greater complexity of the german language (I am german speaking), the commands only work half the time. A nice idea, and a boon while driving or typing. But *only* when set to english.  Rounding out the audiovisual feature set is the Touch's photo presentation ability, really showcasing the touch-based gesture interface. It was the pinch and flick gesture that originally sold me on the Touch, and it still does today. On the Mac, iTunes ties into iPhoto's image management, greatly facilitating the task of sorting out which images to synch to your iPod (on windows, this task is slightly more pedestrian, as you'll have to manually manage the 'My Pictures' folder). A strange quirk, though, is that during synch iTunes seems to downsample your images to a (to me unknown, but definitely) smaller size. Since I'm a photo nut (shooting with DSLR) this 'feature' annoys me somewhat, as iTunes currently does not provide any means to control the downsampling of photos.  The success of the original iPod has left some competitors scratching their heads, while it is blindingly obvious to most users: the tight, seamless integration with iTunes. Now in version 9, iTunes has become somewhat complex and not always that intuitive to use. It now also tries to manage Photos and Movies as well as Music and Applications. But iTunes is still very easy to use, and synchronizing the iPod Touch with iTunes is quick and simple. A small disappointment is the fact that you still can't synchronize your Touch wirelessly, and that it still refuses to mount as an external disk. Another disappointment is that although iTunes now allows you to share your music over the net with multiple Macs, it can't stream your Music to the Touch (A small, brilliant app from the AppStore can do this for you, though).  And while we are speaking of iTunes - there is one feature that I'd love to have on the Touch: the visualizer. iTunes' visualizer is really beautiful, and I would have loved the same functionality on my Touch.   Internet While by itself the iPod Touch is an impressive and fun device, it comes into real swing when connected to the internet. The always-on nature and graceful handling of connection drops make the Touch one of the best internet devices I've used to day. The included Safari internet browser performs great - unless you try to load Flash-based content, which is not supported. The email client works great for receiving and viewing mail. Writing anything but the shortest of email is annoying, as the Touch is simply too small for comfortably entering any significant amount of text. Calendar and Address Book are well executed (even if entering a new date and merging multiple calenders is slightly more convoluted than necessary). Mail, Calendar and Addressbook can (if you have that service available) synch live to either mobile me (which Apple loves to sell you) or Exchange (which your employer loves to force on you) through a feature that is very similar to 'push' notification. In the past, using Exchange has been somewhat spotty, and mobile Me has had it's own share of problems. All in all, though both work nice, and exceedingly quick. You do need to be in range of a hotspot for this to function, though. Somewhat disappointing is the fact that notes are not synched. Another nice addition is 'Voice Memos' which is an audio recorder. Had the Touch an internal mic, this app would have been even better...  Applications Next to the 'productivity' or 'PDA' suite (Mail, Calendar, Contacts) the touch comes with some other nice (but somewhat dull) apps (e.g. Maps, Stocks, YouTube) and two killer Apps: iTunes and App Store. While the former gives you instant access to all songs and movies that are currently available on iTunes (Warning: that, plus the incredible 'Shazam' can lead to unintented gross music spending), the latter (App Store) gives you equal instant access to an incredible number of applications that you can instantly download and use. The quality of applications on the App Store is quite uneven, and tends to cluster around some rather puerile topics (as a veritable, uh, heap, of Fart applications proves). That being said, there are a number of jaw-droppingly good applications that are able to utilize the touch interface (and other capabilities such as accelerometer) in new and surprising ways. Just to name a few are the aforementioned 'Shazam' that can identify a song being played and instantly link to iTunes (you have to see it in action to believe it), Flight Control, where you manage an airport by drawing the flight path for each plane, Bloomberg that provides stock information in an exhaustive way, and Wemlin that shows an up-to-date timetable for when the next tram arrives at my station. No matter what, there probably is an application that supports you with it. And then there are games. Apple had quickly recognized that the Touch represents an immensely attractive and powerful game platform. Performance, screen, connectivity and control capabilities make it the ideal casual gaming platform. Accordingly, games represent by far the largest category in the App store. While inevitably there are some truly awfully executed, or simply dull games, the majority of the available games are at least somewhat entertaining, while some rival and exceed those that can be had for thrice the price on dedicated gaming platforms.    In the past, my Touch quickly filled up with app after app that I simply couldn't live without any more, and an unforseen limitation of the Touch's design surfaced: app management. Applications are arranged as icons on a 4x4 grid per page, with multiple pages that you can flick left and right to navigate. Unfortunately, re-arranging apps, although possible (and quite ingeniously implemented) is still a chore. Apple has done the right thing, and integrated a much nicer app manager into the (PC/Mac) iTunes application.  Speed Improvement The iPod Touch, although seen by some as the 'iPhone's smaller sibling' was always either as nible as the phone, or even faster. The new, 3rd gen Touch is said to be 'up to 50% faster' than the previous generation. To be honest, I'm not sure that I see that speed improvent translate to much performance increase. That may be due to the fact that my Touch seldom maxes out on processor throughput or (for example when browsing) that WiFi bandwidth is the limiting factor. Some apps appear to be 'snappier' during start-up (smaller apps) or execution (games, mostly), but all in all, the Touch pretty much seems to be as fast as the last generation. This leads me to believe that the real bottleneck is it's internal execution memory (i.e. not the 64 GB storage, but processor memory), and ony applications that are specifically written to take advantage of new technology (e.g. OpenGL ES). Or in other words: the overall speed has not been improved that much.  SDK So you want to be a geek? Already are? You can write your own applications for the Touch if you like. I've taken the plunge and downloaded the SDK. Note that you can download the SDK and develop for the Touch/iPhone without actually owning one. The development system comes with a iPhone simulator that you can use to test your applications without downloading them unto an actual device (it does have some limitations: for example, the accelerometers are not simulated, and you have no indication of the true execution speed). Well, you do need a Mac for this (although it can be a few years old). The SDK is impressive - overwhelming even if you are not used to Mac programming (and almost prohibitively complex if you are not used to frameworks like Cocoa and object-oriented programming). Still, crunching out your first (very basic) appliction is surprisingly easy, and if you roll that way, you'll get addicted quickly.  Summary: It's the killer personal entertainment device. Buy it. You know you want it -- especially if you have read this far. If you have the 2nd gen iPod, you may need to ask yourself if the slight speed bump and the additional storage is worth the hefty price tag. To me it was, but your mileage may vary.  pros + world class touch/gesture interface  + best iPod audiovisual experience around (music, video, photos) + killer feature: app store and application availability + killer feature: internet integration (browsing and push technology) + great movie playback + really good casual gaming device + slightly improved speed (allegedly, only for some games) + great integration with mobile me (calender, mail sync) or Exchange + really good SDK if you are geeky enough to roll your own apps   cons - no built-in mic (headphones do have them) - polished chrome backplate (I would have preferred a brushed finish) - no gps, camera, compass - no radio (nano has it?) - no sync of notes, no wireless sync of music/movies - spotty voice recognition in languages other than english - no control over downsampling of photos - no search function for music inside the iPod app - no visualizer

But most of all, the sound quality is fantastic (and not too loud) - and not electronic sounding at all.  And the tunes are all pleasing to the ear and not annoying kid versions.  I will like listening to it as much as our son!

The kids and I have had a blast with them.  The larger screen doesn't make a huge difference but it does look really nice.  I was really sold by the downloadable content, browser(though not used much), cameras and the sd slot.  Awesome features.  I also like the improved volume control as it was very hard to fine tune the volume on my DS lite. I think its a real shame that they didn't include a GBA slot on this one, though it clearly wasn't a deal breaker.  The only other negative is that I'm not crazy about the matte finish.  That's simply a matter of taste, however.  If they had left the GBA slot intact I would have given the DSi the fifth star.

However, after eagerly awaiting this release I was very disappointed to find this album is the censored version! The lyrics in "Bad Romance," "Dance In The Dark," and "Monster" have all been edited to remove the two profane words in GaGa's original lyrics. I am outraged and shocked that a GaGa record would even be released as a censored and edited version. I understand that some people may choose to buy censored music, but I do not as I am an adult and feel that I should have the right to make my own choices about what I listen to. The censoring is really annoying because it sounds as if there is a skipping glitch in the flow of the songs. If I wanted to buy and listen to censored music I would shop at Walmart, which I refuse to do. Censorship is un-American and violates my rights as a free citizen!  The Fame Monster = A+ Censorsed Lyrics = F

I wanted another watch that was less dressy, and was happy when I found this watch at a low price.  However, this watch looks very nice, despite its price.  Some reviewers don't like the watchband.  I agree that a leather band would make it look more expensive, but this is a military watch and the band is quite appropriate. Although the description calls this a canvas strap, the inside is coated so that it does not absorb sweat. Also, I have small wrists and Eco-Drives are the only watches that I can wear without modifying the strap.  It's VERY easy to set.  It is more like a traditional watch; you only need to adjust the main crown.  The other two buttons north and south of the crown control the chronograph.  Seconds tick by on this watch on the small dial located just above the "6" on the watch face. The large second hand that you normally associate with the sweep second hand is part of the chronograph.  By the way, the chronograph is EXTREMELY easy to operate.  One of my favorite features of this watch are the extremely large, easy-to-read numbers on the dial.  Only downside is that the three small dials on the face are smaller and more difficult to read, but I think that is an unavoidable consequence of the design.  Overall, this is a great watch!!
like	0	As a proud owner of a PS3, I was closely following developments of when the rumored (and highly-anticipated) PS3 Slim would come out. After shelling [...] for the PS3 80GB back in 2008, I was really excited to hear that Sony not only announced a smaller version of the PS3, but also implemented a [long-overdue] $100 price cut. I immediately went out and bought the Slim as soon as possible, and am very happy with it so far. Here are my impressions:   COMPARED TO PLAYSTATION 3 "FAT" A LOT SMALLER I heard that it was smaller, but seeing is believing! The photos don't do the system justice, and it's not really till you see and feel the difference that you are impressed with it. If you can, go into your local game store and check it out for yourself! If you've previously owned a Playstation console, you already know the difference the slimmer version makes when compared to the original, bulky ones. What's really convenient is that the slimmer PS3 not only means your video gaming is more portable, but that you have a really convenient Blu-Ray player.   NOT A FINGERPRINT MAGNET I love the sleek look of my PS3 Fat, but don't like how it constantly needs to be cleaned. The glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet! The matte finish on the Slim is much easier to maintain. That being said, it doesn't look as shiny and cool, but I think its convenience outweighs that.   MORE STORAGE Storage was never an issue for me on my 80GB system, but for those who wanted more storage, you get 40GB more with this system (120GB in total). It may not seem like much, but you can hold MANY movies, pictures, and music albums with 120GB. If that's still not enough, you can always install a 2.5" hard drive yourself, or better yet, plug in an external hard drive in one of the USB ports. You can easily get a portable 500GB external hard drive for less than $100, or a bigger, bulkier one with around 1TB of storage for roughly the same. That being said, I think 120GB for $300 should be more than enough for most users, and is a significant improvement over the 80GB for $400 that people were paying just a few weeks ago!   STILL NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE This is my one major gripe with the Playstation 3. It really wouldn't have killed Sony to include this feature, as the original Playstation 3's did in fact include backwards compatibility with older Playstation 2 games. A lot of people counter by either saying (1) it doesn't make sense to buy a PS3 to play PS2 games, (2) the graphics on the PS3 are better anyway so why bother with older games, and (3) including backwards compatibility would cannibalize PS3 game sales.    While those arguments might have their merits, I'm still frustrated that my massive PS2 library can't be played on the PS3, and was really hoping that Sony would include backwards compatibility on the Slim! I loved the fact the PS2 was backwards compatible with PS1 games, and really wish that Sony would reconsider this decision.    COMPARED TO OTHER SYSTEMS: PS3 vs. WII I think comparing the PS3 directly to the Wii is a bit like comparing apples to oranges, since they offer such different experiences. The Wii in my opinion is more family-friendly, while the PS3 is better for more graphics-intense games geared towards different gemographics. I'm a huge fan of Nintendo, and I love their very family-oriented game offerings. I own a DS and Wii and still love Mario as much as the days back when I played the original Nintendo (NES). In addition, I think Nintendo's motion-sensitive controllers for the Wii are very innovative and fun to play with! Unfortunately however, for most gamers, the difference in game quality is noticeable when comparing the two systems. The PS3 has AMAZING graphics. On an HD Television, you notice such crisp details while playing the PS3. The Wii features only Standard Definition output, which noticeably weakens it when compared to the other next-gen consoles such as the PS3 and Xbox 360.    PS3 vs. XBOX 360 Microsoft has an impressive gaming console in their Xbox 360 and there are some amazing titles exclusive to the Xbox, but in the end you get less bang for your buck when compared to the Playstation 3:   (1) Online gameplay: You can use the Playstation Network's online features without having to pay a subscription fee like you do for the Xbox. I was never a big online gamer but now I enjoy playing against opponents online.   (2) Internet connectivity: Built-in wireless internet connectivity on the PS3 is a much better bet than having to buy a wireless network adapter for the Xbox. Of course you can simply rely on a wired Ethernet connection, but this might be inconvenient depending on your set-up. (3) High-Def Video: The Playstation 3 doubles as a Blu-Ray player. Microsoft bet on the wrong horse when they were hoping that HD-DVD would come out the winner in the high-def format wars. If you want a Blu-Ray player/video game system combo, the PS3 is a great device. (4) Failure rate: The Xbox 360 has an absurdly high failure rate, with estimates ranging between 30 to 50% ([...]).  I can't verify the numbers, but know from my friends who own the Xbox 360 that they've had a fair share of grief with their systems.    Microsoft does have a few edges, namely the upcoming Project Natal, unveiled at June's E3. While Natal may ultimately be one of the most amazing advances in video gaming, it unfortunately is still some time off from being implemented. That being said, the Playstation 3 is much more worth the cost than the Xbox 360 - at least for now.    FINAL THOUGHTS [...] system that doubles as a Blu-Ray player. Keep in mind though that the bulk of money spent on the video game system will not be in the initial down payment, but the subsequent games, extra controllers (only comes bundled with one controller), and other peripherals/accessories. [...]. Sony's refusal to incorporate backwards-compatibility for PS2 games on the PS3, however, might make your gaming library obsolete in a few years, so if you have the money, you're best off going for the PS3 Slim. You won't regret it.

On my older desktop system, the installation only took a few minutes.  The laptop I have is much newer, and the software installed even faster.  Absolutely trouble-free, and within minutes I had a picture on screen and was able to take photos and make videos.  The adjustable clip on the back of the camera is very effective - it doubles as a stand, which came in handy on my bulky old non-flat screen monitor.  On my laptop screen it was just as handy, resting firmly in place at the top of the screen.  I was truly impressed by the video quality.  Again, I've never owned a webcam previously, but I've viewed many webcam videos posted on websites - and I was aware that the image quality ran the gamut.  The lens on this webcam produces a very sharp, detailed image.  Even in relatively low-lighting, the picture wasn't bad at all.  On my several years old desktop, the image didn't keep up with the movements very well - moving my head from side to side, for instance, resulted in quite a blur.  But on my newer laptop, that blur was reduced extremely - the movements registered in more or less real-time.  The auto-focus feature seems to do it's job pretty well, and makes operation very simple.    The audio quality was definitely less impressive than the picture - but it was right in line with what I expected for a little tiny built-in microphone.  Loud noises clip and/or distort - I tried playing my saxophone and the result wasn't listenable (though some would say that's due to my playing ability).  Yelling, or even extremely loud talking, clips.  But all things considered, when remaining at a distance of a couple feet and talking at a normal, even volume - the audio quality was very acceptable.  I got a kick out of the various visual features.  There are a bunch of filters - my favorite is the '50s style, creating a vintage black-and-white scratched up film look.  Neonize was a trip - darkening everything on screen except for neon-colored borders to everything.  The 'ghost' filter gives a blurred tracer effect to all movement.  I don't know how much need I'll have for these, but they're fun to mess around with.  There are also a bunch of options to change the look of your face on-screen - including 'robot face' which makes you look like a cyborg or something.  I don't honestly know what the 'avatar' feature was supposed to do - I aligned my face within the red box like it said to, but nothing really happened ever once I initiated the feature...  Bottom line - speaking for total, complete, 100% webcam novices like myself:  this is a quality webcam that I could not imagine being easier to use.  The video quality is top-notch.  My biggest criticism - and this is actually kind of minor - is the utter lack of a storage case or pouch for the webcam.  I don't plan to leave mine out all the time and I'd like to keep the lens (rightfully rated highly) in good shape.  For the time being, I'm actually putting it back in the box but even a cheap felt pouch would've been nice.
like	0	This movie is great! It brings to mind elements of films like "Identity" and "And Then There Were None". Throw a group of profilers on an island, add a killer to take them out one by one, and you have a great thriller! I have to admit that I saw the previews and thought that maybe it was all a set up to test them, but after the first death, you know they aren't faking it! If you like last-minute plot twists, you'll love this movie. Fair warning that the deaths are incredibly graphic sometimes so no eating while watching. It was great to see Val Kilmer and Christian Slater back in action, even if they were in small parts (Kilmer has maybe 10 minutes of screen time).

The bosses are ridiculously huge, and there's lots of them. The combos and special moves are wicked and fun to pull off. And I actually liked that the soundtrack wasn't the typical heavy metal. The story is a little hard to follow, but you can seriously skip the cut scenes and still have an amazing experience.  Now, I heard some negative things about this game before I bought it. The biggest one is that the Xbox version is far superior, allegedly. While I can't compare the two, I can honestly say I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the game. Yes, it has frequent load times. But, you know what? There's so much happening on the screen sometimes, I didn't mind the break. The graphics seemed a little low-res, but the inventive style more than made up for it. I will say, though, that if there is a sequel, I hope the PS3 port gets the development attention it deserves.  A couple other things to consider: You can beat the game on easy in 8 or 9 hours (the difficulty is set so easy means normal and normal means you'll throw your controller a lot). If you want tons of play time for your money, you may want to rent this instead. Also, I'm aware some people are saying that the game is offensive. While the female characters are hypersexual, I didn't see a huge difference between this and something like Tomb Raider.  Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's one of the most memorable I've played in a long time. The good stuff far outweighs the bad. There's a tsunami of amazing games gushing out this year, but don't overlook this one.

like	0	This watch, like most if not all chronograph models offered by Citizen, is more designed for style than function.  The 60 minute dial at 10:00 is too small to adequately time anything over a minute and the hand moves in a sweep rather than clicking fashion, which further confuses the user.  I'm surprised that Citizen even put his series on the market.  Check out the two Swiss Army watch companies and you'll notice they have a 30 minute dial and the hand clicks from one minute to the next.  If you want an Eco-Drive watch save the money and get the plain watch, if you want a chronograph buy another brand.  I have used chronographs for work, recreation, and pleasure for over 20 years and have used several brands and this one is by far the hardest to read and consequently in my opinion is not functional when accurately timing an event is important.

His old watch had fallen apart due to physical beatings (the face was cracked) exposed to the elements (at the time he was stationed in Arizona)and the band was cracking.  I did research and came across the G-Shock. I read reviews for different models all over the internet and saw a lot of military personnel (both active and retired) give this watch rave reviews. It had the perfect amount of features (not too much, not too little) and wasn't flashy and followed his dress code for when he wears his Dress Blues and is lighter than it looks.  My brother got it for Xmas 08 and he has no complaints whatsoever. This watch has been subjected to the same abuse as the other (even more now that he is stationed in Afghanistan)and still looks new. The other guys on his base even liked it and went out and bought their own.  My brother says I found the perfect watch and I highly recommend it to others in the military.

It looked like a fun, cool thing to have during these 106 temps we've been suffering ... and I liked the looks of it. I challenge anyone to look at a beach-ball without thinking of surf-and-turf and happy, fun-filled days of summers past. My mind rocks back to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk and the Beach Boys. ... Ah-hhh ... "California Girls," "Good Vibrations," "Surfing U.S.A" ... Who could ever forget those and other big hits they performed?  Devon was drawn to the sprinkler--as people have always migrated to water--and he liked it for about a California minute ... until the sprinklers squirted him directly in the face with mini-force. He enjoyed getting wet, of course, but didn't like the water in his eyes. Besides, he wanted the ball for himself; HIS toy, you know. So, being a smart kid, he crawled beneath the water-streams and kept trying to roll it. That, in itself was amusing to us adults, but frustrating for him.  As a result, because I think it's pretty, I now use it as a yard decoration ... but only when Devon is inside looking out. And when he's napping, I still "run through the sprinkler" from time to time. Just a big kid at heart.  This isn't an educational toy (nor does anyone claim it to be); it's more durable than the usual beach-ball; and I think it's tons of fun. Even if it's not for Devon--after all, he's only one-and-a-half--it makes ME happy. When not outdoors, I enjoy standing at my upstairs window, looking down on it, while imagining myself standing in the silver jets of water as they cool me off while the colors appeal to my sense of harmony. As I said, it's cool ... in more ways than one!  To each his own, but I think you'll enjoy it too.  Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008 Author of: The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley

I personally liked Twilight better, some of the acting just seemed off to me in New Moon. With this being said, New Moon was my least favorite book in the series so this may be why I didn't like the movie as much.  I have not gotten the chance to watch any of the extra things on the disk so I can't say if it's good or bad.  I would have to say the best thing about the movies are that they picked good looking people and I think that is what pulls a lot of the watchers in!
like	0	This sharply portrayed and picturesque film is no less than a stunning masterpiece!  Finely capturing the gusting momentum of a kingdom and its contending rule, all the while bootying the intricacies of family passion &amp; strife, this movie grasps all by masterfully portraying it within the frame of a Christmas holiday spent at the beauteous castle of Chinon. The year is 1183, and Henry II, insatiate King of the British Empire summons forth his family:  his wife - Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their surviving sons Richard, Geoffery, and John.  They meet at Chinon - and like every gathering of this family must always have been, this meeting is momentous ~ James Goldman wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar he won for this screenplay -- for, not only is it in tune to every orchestral note of this history, but it is also precise as a dagger in its eloquence ~~ I've rarely heard a more masterful script portrayed on film! Such a prodigious screenplay must needs have a brilliant cast and musical score to give it flesh and blood -- and herein you'll find it most heartily delivered!  Katharine Hepburn is absolutely stellar in her portrayal of perhaps one of the most fascinating women in history:  the much-acknowledged &quot;Queen of Love&quot; throughout Europe before she became Queen of France, fighting in the Crusades alongside her husband Louis VII of France - and then Queen of England, wife of Henry II, who had imprisoned her for many years for joining her sons in plots against him.  Henry would free her at times for such holiday family gatherings as this. Hepburn's scenes with Peter O'Toole, as Henry, are pure electrically-charged art!  As King and Queen, parents to the three aspired heirs to the throne, they lay blame and conspire against each other, and their sons will stop at nothing to acquire what they each feel that they deserve:  succession to the throne.  To add to this tangled web of deceit are the young King Phillip of France and his sister, Alice, who had been raised in the household of King Henry, betrothed to Richard since her infancy.  While Eleanor and her sons each plot with the French King, Henry openly exhibits his ongoing love affair with Alice~~ The chemistry of this well-casted drama is flawless - every line spoken a masterpiece of wit and daring.  This movie is a rare find, indeed!

Primatology has often  been dominated by studies on apes, but the Lomas Barbudal project has brought us leaps closer to understanding primate behavior by dedicating decades of intense research to this species of new world monkey. Reading about some of the daily family, political, and terretorial dramas of the white-faced capuchins, you cannot help but see just how similar they are to us.  These are some remarkable and intelligent capuchins just bursting with personality.  They are problem-solvers, drama queens, pranksters, lovers and fighters. I highly recommend this book to any primatologist or person interested in social behavior!!!  This book has some wonderful photos and gives you glimpses into what it is like to be a primatologist in the field. It is a great resource!!!

That's 5-star material if I've ever seen it.
like	0	This album is kind of an odd duck. On the whole, it's produced a lot more like the European pop-dance music (vocal trance, etc) except it has some really odd instrumentation and song structures. Interesting musically. Reminiscent of electroclash with glam elements in the choruses. Lyrics are beyond dumb and occasionally autotuner is used to mask vocal deficits, but this is typical for the genre, since it's about the beats.  Oh, and boy will it get you moving. Real high energy stuff. Great for a workout or the morning drive to work. Every song is good. Nearly every track sounds like it could be a single. A very solid album.  Highly recommended for dance, glam, and electro fans. Most everyone else with a moderately open mind to dance or pop should like it too.  If you like this album, you should probably check out the Veronicas new album too. Another great electro/dance/pop album with rock song structures.

It works much better than I expected.  Very stable, does not slide, and lets me adjust my Nuvi to a variety of different angles.  I can place the GPS anywhere on the dash or even on the center console. Also works great when transferred to my wife's Ford.   Only downside to the device is that it has a rather large footprint, but not prohibitively large.  I like the fact that I can easily use this in both of our family vehicles depending on where we need the GPS.   UPDATE:  Now that I have used this mount regularly since May, I have to say this is the best mounting solution I've found for a GPS or any other device for my car. It hasn't slid out of place once!! Given the rise in GPS units being stolen from cars, this mount allows you to easily stash your GPS Unit and mount out of sight and then put it back into position with ease.  2009 Update:  Still using this in my Prius and my wife has one too.  It's held up quite well.  It IS a bit bulky to store out of the way when not in use, but still a good solution.  I usually remove my GPS from the mount (a simple process) and then place the mount as far under the seat as it will go.  Not perfect, but the best solution I've found to date.

After reading a handful of reviews, I decided that this configuration was the way to go -- and I still believe I was correct (not always the case). The black box fits nicely with our other TV components. The Wii Resort software that comes with the package is so cool as a starter set that I haven't felt the need to purchase other software (yet).   One game in particular has been the source of many hours of fun: Island Flyover. Why? Because it was easy to learn (I'm 55) yet well designed enough to keep me engaged looking for landmarks, white balloons to shoot, etc. Hey, is anyone aware of any other games like this one? If not, somebody should design one or more. I'd buy them!

Frankly, about the only thing she and Democrats probably agree on is that Bush Jr. did not do a good job with the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and 9/11.  But of course, Coulter has some kind of excuse to blame Bush's responsibility on "any old Democrat" even though Democrats may have nothing to do with Bush Jr.'s personal responsibilities or his decision for the country.    I think she makes some good points, and I think some things are just put out there and that she doesn't listen. She just wants only her opinion to be right to an extreme.  She's good at analyzing situations, but she would not be good for a government position requiring much trust to keep stability, that is for sure.  On the other hand, you probably want her to be your Republican lobbyist.  A "friend" a "Coulter Jr." told me about how great this book is.  He acts just like Coulter, but just doesn't publish books and goes out and speaks like she does.  Otherwise, he would probably be doing at least okay- (Coulter created and kept her niche first.)  I am not particularly Democrat or Republican, but I try to give everything a chance.  This book, while giving some fresh perspectives I would not have thought of, is quite hit or miss, too opinionated, and not always reasoning things out enough.

I was never satisfied, mostly because they where too heavy to handle, or the animal hair was blown about, rather than sucked up. I do have a canister vacuum that I have had for years, but I wanted a satisfactory upright that was light and easy to handle. I have a cat and a dog, and there is lots of shedding hair, all the time. Our house is mostly hard floors, stairs, and one large rug in the living room. When I saw the DC25 Animal, I decided to spend the money hoping that this vacuum would do the job. It has lived up to my wildest dreams, it is wonderfully easy to handle, so easy to maneuver, the 16 lbs make such a difference compared to those very heavy machines I had before, I had no problem carrying it upstairs. I love that with this vacuum I don't need to select different heights, it goes from floor to carpet to floor. I was even able to clean the dogs bed without the wand attachment. Speaking of the wand/handle attachment you simply flip open the top cap, pull up on the wand, and it disconnects from the vacuum and suction diverts to the wand. It took a little getting use to, the hose is a little stiff and took a while before I was comfortable cleaning the stairs. Most important, THIS VACUUM SUCKS, but in a good way!!  Assembly was fairly easy, suppose to be 3 snaps with no tools. But I had a heck of a time getting it out of the box, and being not mechanically inclined I would have liked better instructions.  I have never reviewed a product before, but this vacuum cleaner has me so excited that I had to share it with someone. I really love this machine!

It could be argued that he did write Jersey Girl and that could be considered a bomb, but his films usually average about $25-$30 million anyway. A Kevin Smith film isn't really about bringing in a large amount of money at the box office. His charm is in his writing, especially the dialogue and interaction between characters. There's a very specific audience his films will appeal to and none of them have really branched away from that. But him not writing this one made me think, "Eh. Not sure what that'll be like since he didn't write it." When it comes to Bruce Willis, I've never talked to anyone who dislikes him entirely. There always seems to be at least one of his films everybody enjoys. Die Hard, The Fifth Element, and Sin City are just a few off the top of my head. The real buzzkiller for me though was Tracy Morgan. He's just never been funny to me. He was beyond lame on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock has never been able to hold my attention for very long. Not to mention all the trailers for Cop Out didn't make me laugh. Thankfully though, first impressions can be so very wrong.   One of Cop Out's biggest charms is that it feels like a buddy cop comedy you've seen before, but have forgotten how much you enjoy it. The film feels similar to a 48 Hrs or Beverly Hills Cop film. Bulletproof is also a good example. Cop Out is pretty much what you expect when it comes to roles Bruce Willis chooses as it's pretty much no different than his role as John McClane on the surface, but he's a lot funnier this time around. As far as Tracy Morgan goes, the funniest thing I could remember him saying was his one line in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back ("Man... I don't know what the f--- you just said, Little Kid, but you're special man, you reached out, and you touched a brother's heart.") until this film. He was downright hilarious at times. The only person who was funnier than Morgan was Seann William Scott who stole every scene he was in. Even though Kevin Smith didn't pen the script this time around, it still feels like a Kevin Smith film. It could be due to the fact that Jason Lee has a small role in the film, but I like to think it's because Cop Out offers the same kind of comedy you'd find in a Kevin Smith film with a bit more action. It also took me forever to place Scarface from Half Baked as Poh Boy.   Cop Out is surprisingly funny and incredibly entertaining. Give this film a chance even if the trailers may not be doing anything for you. I felt the same way and wound up thoroughly enjoying the film. After a long, stressful day at work, an R-rated comedy with a lot of laughs is one of the best ways to relax and this film offers just that. It's a great film to go into with no expectations other than to just have a good time. As long as you don't run out of the theater, you should catch the part in the credits. This might just be the funniest film released in 2010 thus far. Be sure to check it out. Highly recommended.

When I first saw this book I thought it would be fantastic to laugh at myself and at recent culture for some of the silly things that we enjoy. Not taking things too seriously can be a very good thing.  But I could not come even close to finishing this book. Klosterman thinks he is cynically hilarious and it's just tacky. He goes on and on and on....... about something so that you forget what the main point is. It's not funny at all. He tries way too hard. I tried to pick out things that I could relate to or would find interesting and nothing helped. I felt like he was the awkward kid in the corner who thinks he's cool, trying to say something that will make everyone laugh but that really you feel sorry for, because he's trying so hard, but you can't help but walk away.   The book came up in conversation with a friend of mine, and I offered for him to read it to see what he thought. Needless to say, I wasn't surprised when he basically threw the book back at me a few days later and said that he could barely get through it and didn't come close to finishing it.

Picture quality on Blu-ray is stunning and I've had no compatibility issues thus far; upscaling on standard DVDs is great. VieraCast is a novel feature that could someday find greatness if Panasonic expanded support to include Amazon, Netflix and Hulu. (I understand Amazon support is on the way.)  I have not experienced the freezing issues that some describe here, but I think that's due to how I use the player more than anything else. (I watch a disc or two at a time, then power the unit off between uses - for a technical explanation of why this apparently sidesteps the problem, see the next paragraph.) In any case, I've read online recently that Panasonic has finally figured out the cause of the freezing issue and is now working on a firmware update to fix it.  (For you techies out there, here's a bit more detailed explanation of the freezing issue, based on what I've gleaned online: Blu ray discs make heavy use of Java, and the BD60 apparently has "garbage collection issues" that cause the freezing.  Powering the unit off periodically clears out what's in memory, minimizing the likelihood of another freeze-up. Since I tend to watch one or two Blu-Ray discs at a time and then shut the unit off for between uses, I haven't experienced any freezes.)  The only other quirk I can report is that while the unit does support 24fps playback on DVDs, you have to switch it on manually every time.  Kind of a pain, but only a pain if you're a video purist.  That's it.  No other issues.  Sorry for the boring review, but this player just does everything that it's supposed to without complaints.  I consider it one of the best A/V investments I've made in a long time, and would recommend it to others without hesitation.

like	0	To begin this review, let me just say that I am a silly romance movie connoisseur. The cheesier they are, the better. Unfortunately, despite the fact that I went into this movie open minded, I didn't really like it that much. I have not read the books so I understand that that might have been my problem. While others had a strong foundation and understanding of the Edward/Bella relationship, the movie made it seem like super puppy love as opposed to the undying forever love that I imagined this story was trying to establish,  To be fair, I kept comparing the romance to Buffy and Angel from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There was so much development to their love (granted it was a tv show so they had more time to create their romance) but I really felt that during this movie, Edward and Bella seemed to fall in love over night... and that may be how love is in high school, but I expected more and deeper interaction. This was also upsetting in light of all the many airy non-dialogue scenes of them looking at each other or holding each other. I thought that time could have been used better.   Edward came off as kinda of weird. Very attractive but WEIRD. The whole storming out of class thing looked more like he had to go to the bathroom than like he was terrified of Bella's unreadability. His awkwardness was especially strange in light of the fact that he turned into a super cool guy when they started going out-- taking her to dinner after saving her from those brutes and walking into school and prom with his arm around her. I can see how people like Jacob better. Despite going through high school so many times, Edward does not seem well-adjusted whereas Jacob seems like a nice cool guy.  I was more interested in the background characters than anything else.  Edward's family seems fantastic. The baseball scene was really fun and cute. The fact that they tried to cook for her also seemed so wonderful. Also, Bella's dad seems great. I hope the story develops their relationship more.   I will probably watch the second movie but if that one still lacks substance rather only devoted to Edward and Bella's longing glances at each other, that will be it for me. I tried.

I liked the specification: 4800x4800 dpi and a claimed 11 second scan rate.   The first thing I noticed as I was unpacking the scanner from the box was a mysterious WARNING about unlocking the lid of the scanner.   The scanner was packed with the lid unlocked (as I found out later), and the instructions mentioned to keep the lid locked for travel or extensive handling.  Fair enough, but it made me wonder if I had already done something bad to my scanner (I hadn't).   I then installed the software.  I expected big things from Canon here, because generally they are pretty smart about software.   The software, in terms of use, is much better than the software I had for scanning with my old scanner.    The scanner has an "easy" setting that basically just scans at 300DPI without a fuss.    If you want to scan at full resolution, you have to open the "driver" that exposes a page with all the bells and whistles to let you really fine tune your scan and set the highest resolutions.    All this was fair enough, however I found a few minor disturbing problems with the software.   Firstly, once you've opened the "driver", it's not intuitive to figure out how to get back to the "no brainer" mode.   Also, when you want to save your scan, it always seems to default to the scanning library it sets up.  If you override it, it doesn't stay "changed".   This is a slight pain.  I always wonder who they hire to test and give feedback, because I always feel like I'm pointing out what should be the "obvious" to large companies like Canon (actually I really love Canon - so take no offense!).   As far as scanning speed is concerned, the scanner does indeed scan a 300 dpi page in about 11 seconds (that's pretty fast folks).  However, the estimate does not include the 3 seconds the software takes to respond to the command to begin scanning (I'm running a duo core processor - no slouch) and the few seconds it takes to save the image.   All in all, speed is impressive.   Now on to document quality.  I tried scanning a few brochures and to be honest, at 300 DPI I wasn't super impressed with the result.   So I went into the "driver" at set the scanning at maximum resolution (4800 x 4800).   You get a pretty good result at that resolution, but by no means was I blown away.   Perhaps more "tweaks" of the driver is needed.   I noticed that the scanner attempts to "improve" the picture (which it does) but some of the detail of the text was a little off (brochure had images and text).  I wondered if the lid of the scanner was making really good contact.  Next time I will add a few pages of plain white paper behind the image and see if it makes a difference.   I tried scanning a printed document, and compared it to a printed document I scanned using my old scanner.   I scanned the image to a PDF and low and behold, a major, major improvement (at 300 DPI).   So, I gave the scanner four "stars".  Why not five?   Well, the software is much easier to use than my old scanner, but still not without a few minor "quirks".    This is a great scanner for scanning documents.  How well it will actually scan and reproduce a photo is still in question, and perhaps I need to learn how to use the driver software better.  I don't think I could scan an original photo without seeing some degradation in quality.    I'd be interested to hear other people's experiences regarding copying photos.   I hope I'm wrong in my assessment, because I really expected a 4800x4800 scanner to reproduce "dead on" copies of a photo.

Everyone's buzzing over this "unique" "gritty" compelling story that's "Lord of the Flies" meets "1984", but I would like everyone to know that this is not any new concept.  And further more you will be much more please with the ending of Battle Royale than Hunger Games, because Battle Royale's ending is the perfect ending, with a twist, that no book can beat.  Plus, Battle Royale doesn't throw in a love story just to have a love story.  Suzanne Collins throws in a  "teen" American romance that doesn't reflect real romantic pressures of teenagers.  It just does not work.  You may still enjoy this book but you will be much more satisfied reading Battle Royale by Koushin Takami

This is my first ever Android phone - Full Disclosure: I am coming from an old Blackberry & Moto Slvr so I am not exactly on the bleeding edge of smartphone development. My initial impression after about 4 hours of use is - fantastic phone!  Things did not get off to a good start however when I couldn't get the phone apart to put the battery and SIM card in. I found the trick was to put my fingernail into the slot where you are supposed to split the phone apart and slide it to the left and right to get the top catches to release - others have said pushing the front out by pressing on the speakerphone in back while also using the slot works but I was hesitant to do that.  The size and weight are perfect for my needs as I didn't want something the size of the Spring Evo 4G, etc. Although the big displays on that phone and similar phones are great I just felt they were too big for my daily use (and I had to stay on AT&T). The upside is with the resolution on this screen on a physically smaller screen than say my son's iPhone 3G the "crispness" of the display (especially text) is super.  Physically the phone feels fantastic in hand and the build quality is excellent.  Regarding the two primary AT&T induced drawbacks...no sideloading and AT&T bloatware: for the average user those are probably minor to non-issues. There are workarounds for both issues - the phone has already been rooted (check any of the Android developer forms) and custom ROMs are even available with the AT&T "features" removed. I was going to wait a few more weeks to let the hardware gurus fully explore the phone before making any modifications - but I really want that Swype keyboard.  After a look at some of the AT&T software I think I might have to agree with some of the conspiracy crowd that AT&T would rather not be forced to deal with Android. Initial opening of the AT&T Hotspot app and the page is not centered?? Come on AT&T - at least make it look like you are trying! Sorry - I have been ticked off with AT&T from day one with regard to Android as I never understood how it was in their interest to NOT sell a phone that their customers want given the REAL revenue is in the two year data agreement - not the hardware.  Lots more to explore but I don't think you will be disappointed with the Aria (especially at Amazon's price) if you decide to purchase one.

It took all of 45 minutes just to create a decent sim that I eventually gave up on it--a big blow to me after I had uninstalled all of my Sims 2 content from my computer to make space for this game. Granted, my computer isn't exactly the newest, so I won't fault EA for this problem.  So I was incredibly excited when the friend who had given me the game invited me to her house to play her copy on her computer. I played for all of 20 minutes, and then stopped.  Create-A-Sim is probably my favorite part of the Sims series. I was extremely disappointed in this feature on the Sims 3. In the Sims 2, I enjoyed how the sims' features could be cartoonishly distorted to create some very unique sims. In the Sims 3, they all look the same to me. Pudding faces and muddy hairstyles. I was also highly disappointed in the selection of hairstyles and clothing. The color customization of all items and the traits feature was pretty neat, but that's about it.  Most of all, I loved the feeling of being God in the Sims. That all  the actions, relationships, etc. of every sim was dictated by me. I became attached to my sims because I knew that their failures and successes were dependent upon me. I felt like that was ripped away from me in the Sims 3 with the new Story Progression feature. Even though this option can be disabled, from what I have heard households and relationships are not as they were in the Sims 2. I would hate to become attached to a sim I've created and have them suddenly move away.  I certainly hope EA can fix some of our concerns in upcoming expansion pakcs. For now, I think I'll re-install the Sims 2.

And I did not like it! I did not know such a thing existed until I saw it on an end cap at the grocery store. Pricey....hmmmm....but if it works....would be so worth it.  I apply it in the morning with my AM makeup routine making sure it is dry before I apply any another product on or near my lashes (eyeshadow, mascara, cover-up, etc.) I opted for the morning time, because a night task like that just did not work for me, even though the instructions say to do it at night.  It seems it took the 4 weeks before I started to see changes I could believe were happening. My lashes are now much longer and thicker and hold the curl much better. Its like Rogaine for the eyes!  I guess it is to be a life-long task for me, but the longer lashes sure do add a lot of life to the aging eye! Maybe the price will go down one day!  Oh, I have not noticed any darkening on the skin near the lashes. Occasionally I get some mild burning while it dries. I "think" I felt some weird eye aching in the first week, but that has gone away. I was not sure it was from the "medicine", but chose to live with it!

It's an inspirational story of self-discovery that also imparts our American values of pursuing one's dreams with hard work and perseverance.  I'm a Republican and don't support/like Obama, but this is a great book because it tells a story my kids enjoy about another human being who has made something of his life. (I only wish the McCain book was as well written). I highly recommend this and Winter's other children's biographies if you want your children to enjoy learning about about history and culture through truly inspirational life stories.

The weather in the North Atlantic in the fall is always  chancy, but Captain Billy Tyne (played here by George Clooney) had been the  victim of some poor harvests of late, and he needed fish; moreover, he knew  where to find them.  He was also aware of the risks involved at that time  of year.  What he didn't know and could not foresee (nor could any  meteorologist have predicted), was that three major storms were about to  converge to form one huge storm, the likes of which comes along only once  in every hundred years or so.  And the course he had set was about to take  him, his boat and crew of five men, right into the middle of it.  Director  Wolfgang Peterson recounts this incident in "The Perfect Storm," a deftly  crafted and intense rendering of the story of the Andrea Gail, and its  encounter with the storm of the century.   	What Peterson did with this  film, the way he tells the story, can be likened to what Melville did with  the novel, "Moby Dick;" as it moves along, he fleshes out the characters  and subtly provides an intimate portrait of what this kind of life is all  about.  He pays such meticulous attention to details, that by the time  you're in the middle of the storm, the impact is extraordinary; you know  what this boat is and how it works, you've smelled the fish and the sweat  and the sea, and worked alongside the crew.   You know these people and  what's at stake here.  You know the feel of the fishing lines and the  grappling hooks, felt that rush of adrenaline that comes when you hook a  big one, or when a huge wave washes over the deck.  He gives you so much in  this film, puts you in it so completely, that it primes your senses for  whatever's to come.  Combine all of this with the best special effects  imaginable, outstanding performances, and a terrific score by John Horner,  and you're in for the thrill of a lifetime.			 	The  charismatic Clooney is exemplary here as Tyne, and is able to convey a real  sense of who this man is without resorting to unwarranted theatrics or  bravura.  He simply knows him from the inside out, and it shows in the way  he carries himself, the way he walks and talks, right down to the look in  his eye; the  seasoned professional with all the skill and confidence  required of his job, but a man who is nevertheless also aware of his own  shortcomings.  It's a commanding performance with nuance and depth, all  there on the screen, and Clooney makes it real.   Mark Wahlberg is also  outstanding as Bobby Shatford, the rookie fisherman who can't stand to be  more than two feet away from the woman he loves, Christina (Diane Lane).   Another notable performance is turned in here by John C. Reilly, who does  an emotional turn as "Murph," the veteran fisherman who is divorced, has a  young son he loves dearly, and lives with the remorse of past mistakes that  ultimately destroyed his marriage. 	Rounding out the exceptional  supporting cast are William Fichtner (Sully), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio  (Linda), Allen Payne (Alfred), John Hawkes (Bugsy) and Michael Ironside  (Bobby Brown).  There are thrills and heroics to spare in "The Perfect  Storm," but it's also inspiring; once you've seen the Coast Guard in  action, for example, you'll never take them for granted again.  What makes  this such a great movie, though, is that it's about real people, an  instance of ordinary people getting caught up in extraordinary  circumstances, and Peterson has made them accessible; these are people with  whom anyone in the audience will be able to identify.  This is a powerful,  emotionally charged and unforgettable film; it will take you to places and  you'll experience things from the comfort of your seat in the theater (or  on the couch) that most people will never get close to in real life.  And  therein lies the true magic of the cinema; this is one movie you absolutely  do not want to miss.

I used my gamer tag account and entered my credit card on the TV and I bought 500 points. I got the email confirmation that I bought the points. I then used the points. So far so good.   Over the next two days, four other Xbox charges totaling $30 mysteriously appeared on my credit card. Someone bought more points and a game subscription using my credit card info. I called Xbox Live support- their answer was "we don't give refunds." I explained that it's not a REFUND if my account is used fradulently. They still said no.   Note that clearly the security leak was with them, as no other fraudulent charges appeared on my credit card...just Xbox charges.  I then asked them to delete my credit card info from my Xbox Live account. They said they could not do this. I could not believe this! Given that someone had access to my credit card and they were unwilling to remove my credit card info, I had no choice but to cancel my credit card.  My advice- buy the points from a trusted source like Amazon. Don't ever give Microsoft direct access to your credit card info. I hope this helps.

I couldn't believe the relief!  These insoles treat your feet like babies.  They cushion the foot and raise the arch, and in doing so, they relieve the pain located behind the toes. They also provide relief for the whole foot.  If you stand all day at work or at home, and your feet get tired, you may find relief with this product.  After I used them, I purchased several pair for my brother, who is on his feet all day.  He said that his feet have never felt so good and that he no longer gets tired feet at work.  I have been wearing a pair of these for a year. I am not on my feet a lot, but the inserts have lasted all this time!  Just because they have gel in them doesn't mean they'll wear out tomorrow.    If your experience is like mine, I urge you to try a pair of these insoles.  I think you'll be glad you did.

Let's play "What if." What if a plane carrying a full load of school boys crashes on a deserted island with no adult survivors? What would happen to those boys? What would you expect to happen?  William Golding works with this premise: an idyllic setting, innocent schoolboys. One boy, an older boy just short of teenage years, a boy with fair hair, assumes leadership to stir the others into some semblance of organization and survival mode, much like adults would do if adults were present. He also saw a need to defuse the web of fear of the younger ones. Where are we? How long will we need to wait before someone comes for us? All questions with no answers at this time.  Ah, yes, Golding tells us, everything goes well for a while. But remember the "scar" made by the crashing plane? Something ugly is on this island (but it's not the scar). It's in the bushes, in the dark, in the depths, in the depths of hearts, and it grows like the malignancy it is.  A blatant revelation of what is about to come occurs when Roger silently and stealthily watches a young'un, unbeknownst to the little child. All the young'un is doing is running a stick through the sand, disturbing a crab in a tiny pool of water. Even he imposes control and fear on a helpless creature as Roger boldly picks up a couple of rocks and tosses them the youngster's way. He deliberately misses but comes closer with each throw. Next time he will probably hit the young boy, but not yet. This taboo--deliberately and unnecessarily causing pain to one smaller than you--has not been broken--yet.  Although the dance of the spears, the primeval chants, the attack and killing of the pig, then feasting on its flesh, their kill, are shocking acts of savagery, this event is foreshadowed by the seemingly innocent lob of the stones. From a casual incident, but one with eventual intentionality, the ritualistic slaughter is not so far-fetched or surprising. Golding prepares his readers. This is how the chaos of society starts. It begins with one simple disconnect from the rules. It begins in the minds and hearts. Will I do what society expects? Will I follow the rules to keep things running and working? Do I break a rule or two for my own enhancement. Will I feel a power surge if my rock hits that young `un?  Ralph would probably speak of the terror of knowing that rules WILL be broken. He would speak of the utter horror that any rule can be and will be broken and he won't live to tell about it. Just ask Piggy.  This novel is the only one I taught over and over during the twelve years I worked with high school seniors. My other choices I would switch around those years, drop some, add some. This one I kept. It is that important. I think of "Lord of the Flies" as a necessary manual for societal behavior and an effort to keep the chaos of evil at bay.   Is it even necessary to ask how many times that rock has been thrown since this novel was published in the 1950's? Or how much chaos has imploded so many lives?  Like the way of manuals, some remain in circulation and are deeply read; others fall by the wayside out of disinterest. Some are thrown in the trash. "Lord of the Flies"--what is its current status? And society--how is it doing? Reader, are you a little bit fearful?

Although famous in America, Sarah Palin could go just about anywhere in Britain completely anonymously as long as she didn't meet any Americans along the way. Frankly, Brits normally only take any notice of American politicians if they become president. There are exceptions such as Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, but they are rare. Contrast the number of reviews of this book posted in Amazon USA with the number posted in Amazon UK for confirmation of the lack of British interest.  I realized early on in this book that I was going to enjoy reading it because Mrs Palin's story is both interesting and well-written. She makes summer in Alaska sound wonderful, although acknowledging that the winters are long and harsh. She discusses many aspects of her life and it is clear that she has strong views on a number of issues.   Although not directly relevant to her political career, perhaps the most intriguing question about her beliefs concerns her stance on the origin of species. At first glance, Mrs Palin appears to be a full-blooded creationist, but she denies this. Apparently, she accepts what she calls microevolution, in which species change and evolve over time, but not that people are related to apes or monkeys. Her stance is interesting, but I prefer to accept Darwin's theory, despite the proof of it still being incomplete.  Not having studied the American political scene closely, I'll leave others to judge the accuracy of the main story, but the politics as described here is explosive stuff. Corruption in Alaska, tales of in-fighting within the Republican party and dirty tricks played by some Democrats - all rather sad, but I'll say straight away that similar things happen elsewhere in the world including Britain. Hey, the summer of 2009 was dominated by the expenses scandal at Westminster, while all British political parties of any significance have had their internal fights at one time or another, in between playing dirty tricks on each other. So in one form or another, most of the political stuff here doesn't surprise me, but some of it is shocking nevertheless.  An unconventional politician in many ways, Mrs Palin nevertheless appears to have brought about significant changes in a number of areas in her home state of Alaska, which may seem to many people (especially in my country) like a frozen wasteland, but which is rich in natural resources and occupies a vast land area, approximately equivalent to France, Spain, Italy and the UK combined. So being governor of Alaska is not equivalent to running a small local council in Britain even though it is sparsely populated (fewer people live there than in the county of Leicestershire in which I live). I suspect that the position of state governor may be equivalent to being leader of the Welsh assembly. The biggest Alaskan story by far in my adult lifetime was the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, which Mrs Palin covers briefly; she later had plenty of political fights with the oil companies (including BP as well as ExxonMobil and others) in her time as state governor.  Mrs Palin has drawn plenty of criticism from a variety of sources and uses the opportunity that this book affords to hit back at those critics, often explaining how things have been distorted by the media. Having had my own relatively minor experience of being in British national newspapers, I have sympathy with victims of media distortion, so I don't blame Mrs Palin for hitting back via this book, but I can see that others will react badly. At least my story was a one-day wonder with no lasting consequences, but things are different for those who go into politics, sport or showbiz.  Mrs Palin clearly isn't impressed by the way the Republican presidential campaign was handled, and clearly feels that she wasn't able to contribute effectively to the campaign, but the aftermath was even worse. While some Republicans were happy to cast her as the scapegoat, some Democrats launched a sustained campaign against her that exploited freedom of information laws. Ultimately, this created problems for the legislative process as well as personal difficulties for the Palin family, all described in detail, causing Mrs Palin to decide that she had to quit as governor with a year still to run, even though she was never found guilty of anything. As she acknowledges, that decision to quit may kill her political career, but Mrs Palin says that she did what she felt was right for Alaska. Inevitably in such situations, people will believe whatever they choose to.  I expect Mrs Palin will return to public life in some capacity eventually. That might be as a presidential candidate, but it might alternatively be as champion of a cause dear to her heart. Her vice-presidential campaign generated enormous hope among disabled people, while her love of Alaska makes her passionate about environmental issues. So there's two obvious issues, but I'm sure there are others.  Would I vote for Mrs Palin, given the chance? I don't know because I'd need to know more about issues not discussed in this book, but I'd like the option.  I can see why this book - and the author - are so controversial. Fans of Mrs Palin will love this book, while critics will be furious. Both are likely to have their opinions reinforced by reading this book. Coming from a position of ignorance, I'll just say that I found this book to be compulsive reading.

About the new Voice control function, if you love to take your iPod with you to the Gym the new feature "Voice control" is pretty cool, it does allow you to control your music via your voice, no need to get the iPod out of your pocket you can simply say "Next" to move to next song, say "shuffle" for shuffle , say "Pause" and music playback will stop etc, that is why i recommend the iPod touch over iPod classic for gym users, my friend bought an iPod classic and now he complains that the iPod classic is too heavy for him when he goes to the gym and he will have to buy another iPod "properly Nano" for his Gym, for me i use my iPod touch for the gym, it's so light that sometimes i forgot that it's even in my pocket.      After playing with my iPod touch 3g for a while i honestly did not notice any difference from the outside or the inside compared to my old iPod touch Second generation (It's supposed to be faster but i did not notice anything during music and video playback or the menus, however browsing with safari and loading facebook was faster, same thing with boot time), you properly can only notice it being faster with heavy applications since video/music playback is already fast enough with 2G.    I got the 64GB iPod 3G for [...]$, if you think of upgrading your 2G iPod touch honestly do yourself a favor and save yourself the money unless you really need that much of a storage (I do that is why i bought one), also remember that the 3G battery lasts less than 2G,(3G battery = 30 Hours of music playback versus 2G 36 hours of music playback according to apple official specs)    *VERY IMPORTANT* for the people who wants the new 8GB version, the new third generation 8GB iPod touch is NOT 3G it's a second generation iPod touch but apple did repack it/renamed it to 3rd generation, which seems to be misleading by APPLE and it's not cool at all, it is IPod Touch 2G+Updated firmware and that is it.    The iPod touch 3rd generation 32GB/64GB versions comes with a free mic+remote with the earbuds while the 8GB do not (it comes with normal earbuds), the 32GB/64GB have the New CPU+Graphic (According to apple the new cpu is twice as fast just like the iPhone 3GS) while the new 8GB use the same old CPU/Chip from the old iPod touch second generation.    Here is APPLE description on the iPod touches page about the 32/64GB versions : """Enjoy all the great features of the 8GB model along with better performance, richer graphics and voice control"""     The iPod touch 3rd generation is the same awesome iPod touch second generation was.  You can play your music/watch your videos/play games, even read your kindle books/etc "you can read amazon big description of what it's capable of if you do not know yet, it's better than what would i say because it has pictures and everything.      The iPod touch got the best browser i have ever seen in a portable device, i do not even need to carry my netbook with me anymore thanks to my iPod touch, if you hated browsing with lame browsers that crash a lot or slow (many mobile phones) trust me on this one, the iPod touch browser is not a toy or a gimmick it is a browser you can depends on, it's super fast and smooth and after using it for like a full year it has only crashed on me once!    Short list of pros and cons about the iPod touch    Pros:  -Slick,small and light device  -Great touch screen  -The BEST web browser on a portable device  -Amazing video/music playback  -App Store (Too many cool applications for Free)  -Display screen is clear and bright  -No bugs and annoying stuff a very reliable hardware  -64GB Flash based mp3 player   Cons:  -Not much of an upgrade over 2G (people were disappointed because they did not get upgrades like camera/OLED/etc)  -Weaker battery, only lasts 30 hours for music playback versus 2G iPod touch 36 Hours music playback  -Expensive for the 64GB version  -Still no FM radio without the use of online applications  -Bluetooth is still half locked  Update : one more reason to avoid the 8GB ipod touch, Apple announced today "April 09 2010" that iPhone 4.0 OS will be released this summer and it will bring many new features to the iphone and ipod touch, however some features like Multitasking will only be available for iphone 3GS and higher or Ipod touch third generation and higher (As i said before the 8GB is second Generation only, a third generation 8gb ipod touch do not exist! so you wont be getting multitasking if you buy the 8GB ipod touch),    I hope my review was helpful :)

And her daring as well, she is willing to confront unusual sexual issues in a genre where sexuality is more often a matter of hints and gestures.   Struck by the intensity of the sexual focus in her recent work I thought it would be entertaining to go back and reread some of Hamilton's earlier books. "Guilty Pleasures" is the first of the Anita Blake series.  What makes the series unique is the strong, tough-minded character of the heroine and narrator.  Before "Guilty Pleasures" vampire stories rarely had female leads, let alone one with the hard-nosed style of Anita Blake.  She is a professional animator (one who raises the dead) and a licensed vampire killer in an alternate earth where vampires have come out of the closet (coffin?) and are active participants in American life. Hamilton's vampires are of the Anne Rice genre.  They are beautiful, deadly and follow their own code of ethics.  Many humans have become enthralled with them, but many are deeply suspicious.  To Anita they are monsters who, when they go out of control, must be killed.  But U.S. law protects vampires that behave themselves.  Even so, when someone starts killing the vampires of St. Louis, authorities make little progress.  Angered, two of the strongest vampires in the city, Jean-Claude and Nikolaos, convince Anita to hunt down the killer. Jean-Claude is one of the modern romantic vampires, easy to look at with fine manners and style.  Nikolaos, on the other hand, is a thousand year old sadistic horror in the body of a thirteen year old girl.  Her powers are unimaginable and dark hungers hide under her innocent looks.  The vampiress takes an immediate dislike to Anita's feisty style and our heroine spends as much time dodging Nikolaos' efforts to injure and enslave her as she does seeking the killer.  Jean-Claude comes under attack as well as he tries to help Anita. Hamilton's way with characters is one of her great strengths.  We meet several of Anita's regular companions for the first time.  Edward the hyper-violent bounty hunter, and Veronica, a private investigator and friend are outstanding, as are many of the bit players.  Her vampires and their human servants are vivid personalities.  This gives the novel a realistic feel that comes as a surprise in the vampire genre.  The plot is fast paced, often moving from cliff-hanger to horrific confrontation with all the agility of the ball in a pinball game.  There is a steady sexual undercurrent that veers towards sadistic and fetish oriented pleasures.  It is a natural outgrowth of the vampire personality and is as chilling as it is erotic.  In "Guilty Pleasures" it is an effective plot device that keeps the heat turned up.  If you are a vampire story fan you will find Laurell Hamilton's efforts deeply satisfying.

Setup was easy, sound is incredible...OSD is fantastic. Sub is loud for being passive and audio is crystal clear. If you get sick of the speakers that come with the system you can easily switch the speaker setting to "large" and upgrade your speakers as you see fit. I have it hooked up to a PS3 (slim...and it plays DTS-HD and Dolby TrueHD perfectly), a XBOX 360 (Call of Duty with this system is rediculous...no more sneaking up on me), and a Wii (eh, it's a wii...my cd player sounds better but thats not the Recievers fault at all). Subwoofer is big (FYI) I have it in an apartment and this thing will rattle walls if I turn it up. Packaging was excellent...nothing is getting damaged in this box (though it is a rather big box). I'll extend my review after I play around with the system in the next couple of weeks.

I must say that it is somewhat satisfying to understand the thought processes behind this president.  He is a remarkably bright individual who overcame a somewhat deprived childhood to excel at some of the world's finest educational institutions.  Given the ineptitude of the current administration which won on pedigree, it is refreshing to know that hard work, intellect, and perseverance can also lead to the White House. The book has a few tedious moments.  The Arkansas campaigns are littered with the names of individuals no one outside of the Ozarks will recognize.  On the whole though, this book delivers for the aficionado of American politics.  You will see the deep thought and debate surrounding policy decisions.  You will appreciate the fact that this president actually led his administration with his own ideas and strategies for implementing them.  Likewise, he wrote many of his own speeches and routinely held press conferences without knowing the questions in advance.  I would have liked even more from these areas, but the book does provide as much depth as most political memoirs. What I would like from Clinton's second book would be a discussion of the perception and reality of American politics.  For example, the Bush administration, with annual budget and trade deficits of over $1 trillion, has the most liberal fiscal policy since the Johnson administration.  At the same time, they have increased the size of the government more than any other administration in history, with the effects of the war and 9/11 accounting for only 45% of this enormous growth.  Clinton, on the other hand, was extremely conservative during his second term, shrinking the government, slowing the growth in expenditures across the board, and balancing the budget.  Yet, Clinton is reviled as being too liberal by conservatives who don't seem to do their homework.  It's too bad they're unwilling to spend time reading a book like this instead of allowing radio talk show hosts to fill their heads with lies that matter.

like	0	I had read and enjoyed Haruki Murakami's tetralogy (Hear the Wind Sing, Pinball, A Wild Sheep Chase, and Dance Dance Dance), and I loved his Wind-Up Bird Chronicle novel, but I was ready for something new.  In reviews and on websites, I had read over and over about Norwegian Wood, the &quot;straightforward&quot; novel that was published years ago in Japan, which still was not for sale in the states, since there was not an authorized translation available. This novel sold a HUGE number of copies in Japan. I was wondering: I love those other novels by Murakami. Are they so demanding? Complicated? If Norwegian Wood is so much simpler than the other novels, will I even like Norwegian Wood? The plot: It's the late 1960's. College student Toru falls in love with the girlfriend of his (dead) best friend. She eventually becomes ill (though not physically ill) and has to leave to live under special circumstances, far away from him. While she's gone, he meets Midori, a college student who obviously is interested in him. But he's holding out for his girlfriend Naoko. Never knowing if she will recover from her ailment and be able to rejoin him in society, he goes to classes, sells phonograph records at night, and spends some time with Midori. He visits Naoko a few times, gets to know her wacky roommate/friend/mentor Reiki, and eventually he has to decide between a life with Naoko (without Naoko?) or with Midori. Throw in a bizarre Geography-major roommate nicknamed &quot;Storm Trooper,&quot; a scene where Midori (badly) sings folk songs to our Toru while they watch a neighborhood fire from the balcony above her parents' bookshop, and assorted other hilarious/bizarre characters and passages, and you've got vintage Haruki Murakami. My favorite scene is one in which Midori takes Toru to visit her ill father in the hospital. He's so ill he can barely eat or speak, but Toru convinces Midori to enjoy a respite, and take a walk by herself out to a park in town. Toru is left alone with this bedridden stranger, in a situation that would seem forced, harsh, and impossible to enjoy, yet they make some very odd and touching inroads with each other. It's very unusual, and perfect in just the way that so many of Murakami's scenes seem to be. The novel isn't as complex as Haruki's other work, and it's missing some of the magical realist / sci-fi / unexplainable elements that were so prevalent in Dance Dance Dance, Wild Sheep Chase, and Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. However, this novel is just as enjoyable, and just as worthwhile. This novel has a sustained emotional depth that other works by Murakami only achieve in passages.  If you're a fan of modern literature at all, do yourself a favor. Read Norwegian Wood, and read Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.  ken32

BIG MISTAKE.  Lesson learned - read the reviews - many negative comments.  I used it for 3 days, and readily understood the description (...) of "eye candy" (looks nice, but seems like cheap plastic) and weak coffee (what they describe as a feature - allowing the coffee to steep - is really a euphemism for a poorly designed system that is guaranteed to give you a weak cup of coffee).  One redeeming feature - the carafe is very nice. Within 2 days of having the Krups, i was on Amazon looking for a replacement coffee maker (a good cup of coffee is critical in the morning!).  I went out on the risk curve and ordered the new Cuisinart - no reviews yet.  The Cuisinart has a more classic brewing system (water goes through grinds via gravity), yields a delicious cup of HOT coffee, has a variable temperature hot place, and looks and feels solid.  We happen to have stainless steel appliances (refrigerator, freezer, stove), and it matches beautifully.  Best news - excellent coffee!.  I would highly recommend the Cuisinart.

I wish everyone would wear these all the time so I could get away with wearing them for more formal occcasions like business meetings. They're kind of funny looking so I intentionally buy them in outrageous colors so they're even more obvious!  Yu can wear them with the strap forward like a clog or around the back of your heel.  You can wear them with or without socks.  You can wash them too.  You will love these.

like	0	This is the 4th Panasonic vacuum cleaner I've owned in the past 15 years (I have a 3-story home and like to keep a vacuum on each level).  This commercial Panasonic vacuum doesn't seem to have the suction that my previous regular Panasonic models had (or maybe it's the brush roll?) We have several furry pets and I must vacuum the same spot over and over and over to get the fur up...and the results are only so-so.  For the past couple of years I had been using a big, clunky top-rated (by Consumer Reports) Sears Kenmore vacuum on the main level of our home, but as the attachments on the Kenmore would fall apart while in use, I quickly relegated that vacuum to the basement.  It did, however, remove pet hair quite effectively.  Everything else about the Panasonic commercial vacuum is a winner...especially the well-fitting attachments.  I love the longer cord so I can keep vacuuming from room to room.  The unit has the by-pass motor feature, which saves $$$ in the long run.  I would have given it 5 stars if it was better on pet hair.  It is ultra-light weight and very easy to use.
like	0	The original Mass Effect had a few flaws, but I consider it to be a solid game.  When Bioware developed this sequel, it seems like they tried to "fix" a little too much.  Mass Effect 2 game feels more like a shooter than its predecessor and the combat is less forgiving even on the "casual" setting, which is disappointing for anyone who liked the more relaxed pace of the first game.  However, it retains several RPG elements to maintain the series' feeling of depth, which might annoy gamers who want to get straight to the action.  It's a classic case of trying to please everyone and sacrificing the overall quality in the process.  That being said, there's still plenty to like in this game.  Heavy weapons are a welcome addition, the Mako vehicle is a thankful omission, and the game is just as polished overall as the original was.  If you're a shooter fan who's a little burned out on Halo 3: ODST and Modern Warfare 2, or are planning on picking up Bioshock 2, you may want to skip this title.  Fans of the first game will be a little disappointed, but they should enjoy the return of Commander Shepherd.

I lucked out because the DVDs have been out less than a month. The actual film, of course, is worth 5 stars all by itself and is a classic adaptation of a beloved novel, so what I want to talk about is why Anne's fans should pick up the DVD version as well. There are cast bios, previews of the other "Anne" works by Sullivan films, and some production stills.   However, the chief charms of the DVD version are the following: First, there is Megan Follows' audition for the part of Anne, which is fascinating to see her first attempts at nailing the character of Anne Shirley. You will notice considerably changes in her actual performance, but the raw talent is amply displayed. Second, there are missing scenes, most of which have to do with the wife of Reverend Allen. It seems the production was co-produced by a German company and so there was this extended subplot with Mrs. Allen, played by a German actress, that was fully integrated into the Germany version of "Anne of Green Gables." Third, there is Directors Commentary from Kevin Sullivan and the film's editor, although the latter is there mainly to given the director someone to talk to during the almost four hour film. The commentary is certainly fascinating, as we find out where certain scenes were short (mostly around Toronto, but some on Prince Edward Island), when scenes were shot (Megan would have to play Anne at 16 in the morning and 12 in the afternoon), as well as great stories about Colleen Dewhurst leaving a scene about to explode in laughter or adding a line.   However, for all these fascinating tidbits about the production you will find yourself surprised from time to time that Kevin Sullivan often does not have a clue about the story of Anne and why it works. He expresses surprise, for example, that audiences find the scene where Anne thanks Matthew for the dress with puffed sleeves to be so emotional. Sheesh. She is looking at him with absolute love and devotion in her eyes and he says, "Don't you like it." Of course it gets to you. But not Sullivan apparently. Still, the commentary is first rate and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it and using it to track down sites I intend to visit later this week in Toronto (I am going to find THE BRIDGE!). Finally, there are some behinds the scenes clips. Warning, this was a television news story on the production and is not the excellent behind the scenes documentary that aired on PBS. Obviously, my only complaint with this DVD is going to be the exclusion of that documentary, which, I supposed, belonged to PBS and not Sullivan productions. So, I know that most of you reading this not only already have "Anne of Green Gables" on videotape, you have had it for a long time. I am just here to tell you that picking up the DVD version as well is worth the additional expenditure.

This story illuminates this fact, as we enter the world of Kino, a pearl diver and occasional fisherman, his wife Juana, and their baby son, Coyotito. All they have is a grass shack house, a few clay cooking utensils, and their prize possession, Kino's boat, inherited from his father and grandfather. The boat is the family's livelihood, providing the means to put a meal on the table and to provide a few pesos for store bought goods by selling the small pearls Kino is able to find. But Kino and his family, far from being depressed or unhappy, have a great treasure, the love they have for each other and their satisfaction with life as it is, with few disturbing dreams of greater things. But their quiet, routine life is turned upside down the day that Kino finds a Great Pearl. Suddenly Kino can dream of better things: a rifle for himself, school for his son so he will be able to read and tell what is really in the books, a real house. But dreams can be deadly things. Dreams lead to desire, and desire to greed, and greed to violence. What happens to Kino and family from this point on is not a pretty story. Now we see that underneath the quiet, idyllic seeming small town and its inhabitants lie the seeds of cheating, betrayal, collusion, fear, and murder. And we see the gradual loss of Kino's real treasures. By the end of the book, events have reached the level of real tragedy, and you, along with Kino, are liable to end up in a state of emotional exhaustion. Steinbeck's prose for this book matches his characters and situation very well, a very minimalist sentence structure and set of speech patterns. As a parable, the story has a strong moralistic point, but Steinbeck does not overdrive his thematic message, but lets his story speak for itself. One of Steinbeck's great strengths was his ability to capture on paper the characters he saw around him, and this book is a showcase for that talent. The characters of Kino and Juana are exquisitely drawn, real people you can relate to even though their lifestyles may be very far from your own. And because they are real people, it is very hard not to get drawn into their lives, where their dreams and their pains very readily become your own.  This may not be Steinbeck's greatest book, as it is too short and with too limited a focus to compare to something like his Grapes of Wrath. But within its own territory, there are very few other pieces of literature that are even half as good.

So just find yourself an a adapter or get yourself a new keyboard.  The price of DDR3 is cheap so its not so much a big deal to invest in.  There is one PCI slot and now with the newer BIOS update its SLI compatible which is great since when I read the description it says that its only Crossfire ready.  If you want to go with something beyond two way SLI than you may want to go with the EVGA model which has more DIMM slots as well.  I was going to go with EVGA but my new case would not allow it and I don't have the budget for three cards.  I like the way the board is situated with DIMM slots running vertical and looks like everything is closer to the processor than on other boards I have seen.  I guess when everything is moving at light speed a smallest measurement closer makes a difference on a motherboard.  Install is a cinch just make sure you take your time and don't rush and make a stupid mistake.  I have found that in my experience I mess up on stupid things instead of something big.  Overclocking has been a little more simplified on this board which is what you should probably do if you invest in these boards.  Overall this board has everything that I need with lots of SATA and USB ports and its super fast with my i7 920 along with my 6 Gigs of Corsair Dominator DDR3.  All I can say is I can't wait to get my hands into some overclocking when I get the free time.  Keep in mind only 64 bit Vista will see anything above about 3 and a half gigs so if you don't want 64 than just be ready not to see what you put in.  One minor issue is the setup of the PCI Express slots since I have an 8800 GTS (one of the fatties) and a Creative X-Fi sound card it doesn't leave room for another 8800 GTS without me having to remove my sound card.  Its not that big of an issue though since I plan on getting a smaller newer card anyways.  Though if you have a fat card like me and something in the PCI slot and want to run SLI you might run into trouble so that is worth noting in my mind.  Is this board worth it though I would have to say absolutely yes.  According to Intel sticking in a fourth stick will cause a degrade in performance so since most ram that's DDR3 come in three packs its not so much a big deal.  Also when it first came on and I entered BIOS everything was recognized but I could not get the thing to boot my ROM drive and it would just sit there with a black screen and then it would ask me to select cd drive type 1 or 2.  After about three hours or so it all of a sudden worked after I selected 1 it booted finally and everything was installed (operating system).  The next problem was it would not restart and as soon as my computer would go off and come on again it would be a black screen going nowhere.  Then I remembered update your BIOS dummy and I read all the notes and a lot of issues I had was fixed in the BIOS update including my restart problem.  There was an issue also with my type of ROM drive not booting when put first in priority and that is the issue I had with trying to get it to boot to install my operating system.  Now everything runs perfect and I could not be happier.  The reason I put all this in my review was it did not go as smooth as I thought it would and someone else might have problems.  If you do have issues just drop me a comment and maybe I can help you out just from what I had to do.

I was beyond ecstatic when the MyTouch 3G was released, but after playing with the device for 3 hours I realized what a piece of crap it was and returned it. The screen wasn't that big and it made texting and instant messaging a living nightmare. In addition to that, the phone was not multi-touch capable, so if you're a fast texter and really quick with the emails then the MyTouch 3G is not for you. The virtual keyboard could only handle one letter at a time and I found myself hitting the wrong letters on so many occasions. I would hit a letter and the phone would pick up the surroundings letter. This really is ashame because the thirty-five dollar data plan is mandatory and its travesty that one can't even use it to the best of their ability. The lack of a keyboard also made the MyTouch 3G a big downer. Anyway, I digress.   Now, let's get to the Motorola Cliq. This phone is everything that the G1 and MyTouch 3G should have been, but better. This device doesn't come with Eclair (Android OS 2.0), but it functions just fine. Hopefully a mandatory upgrade will be made available to all Android users soon. This is a great PDA smart phone for anyone who is heavy into texting, emailing, and surfing the web. It's a full featured phone, but at the same time it's nothing groundbreaking. There is definitely some acclimation when it comes to the Cliq because I am so use to my Blackberry 8900 and I think its one of the best built devices with a very responsive well built OS.   If you're looking for a device that is very similar to the iPhone on the T-Mobile network then this is probably the closest that you will ever get. My initial impression of the phone was not a good one because it kept asking me to create a user name and password. I thought it was asking for an email address (Yahoo, AOL, Gmail), but it wasn't. It was asking you to create a MotoBlur account. I did, but kept getting an error message. T-Mobile customer service didn't know what to do and [...] has an area to sign into MotoBlur & an option to create a motoblur account, but when you click it there's nothing on screen that lets you create a name/password.   Android OS - Many people have said that the Android OS is a game changer since its release back in the fall of 2008. It seemed like the only thing at the time to combat with the forces of the iPhone. To some extent it is and to some extent it's just not quite there yet. To be honest it's a bit on the clunky side. It does take a few seconds to exit out of certain applications, or to even get to the main home screen menu when exiting out of email and texting. When you become so use to using your cell phone for just about everything - speed is everything. That also includes how responsive and quick your phones OS is. My only gripe is that I wish there wasn't that few second lag in-between operations.  Motoblur - The Cliq includes MotoBlur which lets you connect your Facebook, MySpace, and twitter accounts directly to the advice, so whenever your friend writes a new comment it immediately goes to the homepage of the phone. This is a great idea and saves you time from going into the web browser and having to log in each account in order to check for updates. However, this feature is a battery killer. I have mine turns off, besides if you lend your phone to someone else to use (To make a call or use web browser) they will all be up in your business. I could careless about this feature.    Email - This is also not an Android device that has Google branding with it. It's just a Motorola phone using the Android OS. There is NO G1 branding logo anywhere. However, you can still sync up your Google email address, but the Gmail feature is such a disappointment. Synchronization has to be turned on for the Gmail to function to the best of its ability & that's a BIG battery draining feature. You can also sync your Yahoo & AOL email addresses. The AOL and Yahoo email feature is way better then Gmail and doesn't require synchronization to be turned on. This helps save tremendous battery power. When you send an email from your desktop it doesn't come to the phone right away, but you can set the phone to check for new emails every 15 mins, 30 mins, or manually, etc. It doesn't work the same with Gmail which is a big let down. I am a big fan of the Blackberry and it's the only device on the market that gets an email within 2 seconds of sending it. The same can't be said for the Android OS. Much work needs to be done.   Web Browser - One of the best features on any android device including the Cliq is the web browser. Surprisingly, it doesn't launch [...] as the main homepae when you click browser. The Android Browser is probably one of the best browsers on the market right now and is up there with the Safari Browser and the Palm Pre's browser. You cant pinch and zoom to enlarge the way you can on the iPhone, but there are zoom in controls which are easy to use. You also get a dedicated YouTube app that lets you watch Youtube videos. Though the video clips aren't as sharp as the iPhone - There is a setting and option when you are watching the YouTube clip where you can see the videos in "Higher Quality" so its crystal sharp and less blurry.  There is a big difference that one will notice when switching from standard to HIGHER QUALITY.  3G - TMobile recently launched their 3G network about a little over a year ago, so they are still building from the ground up while the other networks are already moving into 4G. It's great that the CLIQ has 3G, but it does get spotty and unresponsive sometimes. There were many times that the 3G would switch between 3G and EDGE. I didn't have that big of a problem with it, but I am sure over time it will get better. Wi-Fi is also included, so this is a great alternative for someone who might be at home and only has EDGE access.  Instant Messaging - The CLIQ comes with Yahoo Messenger, Google Talk, and AIM pre-installed. My Blackberry 8900 came with all 3 and included ICQ & Windows Live. Another thing about the IM that was such a disappointment is that synchronization had to be activated in order for you to sign into the messaging client, which in turn drains the battery power like crazy. This was such a disappointment. My BB never had this issue. You sign in and start chatting. There was no extra setting that had to be activated in order to chat, but on the CLIQ it's a requirement. The extra requirement only means that you have to charge you phone twice in one day because of heavy unnecessary usage.  Motorola really could have done a better job with the CLIQ, especially for the price. But I think most of the minor flaws have to do with the Android OS. I was originally an iPhone user that became a Blackberry user and I have to hand it to the Blackberry because it's quick, responsive, and built in such a way that its function is superb. Everything from Email to text to instant messaging is just so quick. There is hardly any lag and it's easy to learn how to use. The Blackberry so far is the best PDA I have ever used, but its web browser needs work. Pick up the CLIQ phone because it's a winner. There are some minor flaws, but the pros outweigh the negative.   Pros:  Android OS (Can be a pro & a con) Full HTML Web Browser  Threaded Text message  Email sync  Android Marketplace  Full qwerty keyboard  YouTube Application 5.0 camera/camcorder  Big vibrant screen  3.5 MM headjack  Decent call quality (No issues yet)  Mini SD up to 32GB  Use your songs as ringers  Wi-Fi  Personal Email (Up to 10 accounts can be added)  IM My Favs  Excellent Multimedia Player  Includes 2 chargers (Wall Charger & USB charger)  T-Mobile offers the best minute and data plans on this planet   Cons:  Poor Battery Life (Lower light setting and turn off Motoblur to save power)  Gmail is a disaster (Not push capable)  Needs better notification options when next text/emails come through  No PUSH email capability  Trackball (I miss you)  Occasional lag time when entering/exiting a screen/app Micro USB (No more Mini USB)  No ear phone or free carry case

So that was the deal breaker.  The Kalani is sturdy despite the few cam-locks.  Grandpa had no problem with the assembly and finished within an hour.  This is for my 3rd child as I converted the old one already.  Features that were hard to find in one crib but offered in this one:  1. rich cherry finish that complements other cherry furniture in the baby's room.  2. heavy and sturdy  3. 4 height settings.  Perfect for a shorty like me to easily set down a sleepy baby.  most cribs only offer 3 settings that are either too far apart or does not make much of a difference.  4.  mattress springs.  i don't like slats or MDF panel to support my bouncing baby boy.  slats are a pain to adjust and MDP could slip and slide around.  5. toddler rail is included, which saves a hundred bucks.  6. converts to a head and footboard sleigh bed.    Cons: Nothing for the crib.  But I would not spend $$ on the furniture accessories from DaVinci.  $400 bucks for baby size dressers?  MDF and cheaply made?  I would recommend going to a furniture store and purchase a real dresser for less or at least comparable that will outlast the crib stage.  I have Broyhill dresser, chest, and nightstand for his room that matches the crib and I know will last after he's done with the crib (off to college and converted back to a guest room).  Another recommendation:  corner changing table in cherry.  I don't recall the brand but the color match is great and can be used as a credenza once potty trained.  fits nicely in a corner, does not take up much space.  I don't like the DaVinci changing table as it looks silly to use it as anything else with that immovable side rail.  Crib bumper: PBkids- super thick and 'cushiony' or RHbabyandchild- cover removes for easy washing.  I'll post a photo once all the decor is up.  So, good luck and congrats on the new baby!

I kept reading hoping that there would be a moment when the author would reveal some revelation or personal growth out of her horrible circumstances. However, the book was unorganized and pointless. I found the author to be a typical academic stuck in a library and unaware of how to relate to the real world. Her condescension towards her heritage and anyone that isn't "brilliant" is ironic since she has made some really pathetic personal decisions in her life. I also was offended by what seemed to be her disdain for Christianity, which showed her true lack of understanding of it. I do not recommend this book, and I would be, quite frankly, embarrassed to pass it along. I found her comments about her own people disrespectful. And finally, as others have mentioned, if you are going to read it, have a dictionary standing by.

As a former apologist for Bill Clinton, I have to say that this book was a revelation to me and frankly made me a little queasy.  I can't believe that I helped put this man in office.  Morris can speak with genuine admiration about many of the positive steps, but also chronicles the dark side in a way that many of my former fellows will find hard to accept.  Despite some significant accomplishments during his administration, there was confusion, ineptitude, cronyism, lack of vision, and downright corruption.  I was on the one hand proud of Clinton for things like his extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which lifted so many low-income families out of poverty, and on the other hand absolutely enraged by the dithering and delay and lack of action in Afganistan, Iran, Iraq, Bosnia, and Rwanda that contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths, thereby emboldening Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda to commit acts of mass murder on our own soil.   I am left with the forlorn feeling that, with both the Clintons, there was always a lot less there than meets the eye.  Allow me to apologize if you disagree with my perspective...my advisors made me write this...

It is as close to a DVD movie as a video game can get, because, unlike most first person games, players can see and hear the player character as well as the non-player characters (NPCs).  This movie-like quality greatly enhances the compelling story, which is the hallmark of the Mass Effect Trilogy.   THE PLOT **Spoiler Alert** This second episode of the Mass Effect Trilogy begins with the death (yes, DEATH) of Commander Shepard, in a fiery ambush of the Normandy, two years after he/she defeated the traitorous Saren Arterius in the battle of the Citadel.  But, thank the goddess, he/she is later resurrected in Project Lazarus by the Illusive Man, leader of Cerberus, a shadowy and ruthless "human supremacist" organization, for the sole purpose of sending the legendary commander to investigate a new cataclysmic event in the Galaxy: entire human colonies have been vanishing without a trace, leaving behind empty buildings. To confront the threat, Shepard travels across the Galaxy to recruit up to a dozen of the most dangerous characters to his/her elite team, at locations including Illium, an asari colony, and Omega, a lawless mining station built on a hollowed out asteroid in the Terminus Systems, for a mission from which every member of the team, including Commander Shepard, may never return. **End of  Possible Spoilers**  THE CHARACTERS  Players who had completed Mass Effect 1 (ME1) can import a Save Game from the list of Character Saves  into Mass Effect 2 (ME2).  During the file transfer, they have the option of changing the class of Commander Shepard, for example, from adept to vanguard, as well as his/her physical characteristics. This is possible in the storyline on account of Project Lazarus--a very clever way of putting Shepard on reset. If  Shepard was imported at a high level in ME1, players will be awarded with bonus squad points and research metals at the start.  (See my comment below.) All the NPCs who were alive at the end of the ME1 are transferred. Furthermore, the story in ME2 unfolds in accordance with the decisions made by the players in ME1, for example, whether Shepard set the Rachni queen free in Noveria, whether he/she resolved the conflict with Wrex on Virmire peacefully, or whether he/she called in the human fleet to save the Council in the battle of the Citadel. For those who never play ME1, ME2 can be played stand-alone with new characters and certain pre-set assumptions on events in ME1. New characters in ME2 include Thane, a drell master assassin, Legion, a free-thinking geth, who is stalking Commander Shepard, and Subject Zero, a female human biotic gang and cult member, with head-to-toe tattoos. Other than the geth and the Reapers, new enemies emerge in ME2. They include the Collectors, a winged insect-like species who are suspected to be working for the Reapers, and Scions, which are grotesque experiments of the Reaper, as well as monstrous beings created by the Reapers out of other species they abducted.   THE GAME/COMBAT SYSTEM The Artificial Intelligence (AI) and combat system have been vastly improved in ME2.  Gone are those annoying texture pop-ups in ME1.  So are those long elevator rides--they are replaced with loading screens.  Battle scenes are more realistic: enemies are thrown against walls, limbs are blown off, and wounded fighters continue to fight by crawling on the ground.  Players can hit the enemies where they place the reticles, like in a shooter.  (This is not so in ME1, where hits are calculated based on the number of skill points assigned by the players to the characters.)  Players can now issue attack orders to Shepard's squad mates by using the directional-pad of the controller (of the Xbox 360), and manually prompt Commander Shepard to duck behind covers.  The limitless ammo is no more in ME2.  It is replaced with removable "thermal clips".  When a clip is spent, it must be ejected and replaced with a new one. Players are therefore advised to take note of the amount of thermo clips available during battles.  Instead of only four weapon types as in ME1, there are nineteen in ME2. One of my gripes with ME1 was the lack of heavy hand-held weapons.  In ME2, they are available to the soldier class player character (as well as Commander Shepard of all classes).  These heavy weapons knock down multiple enemies in one gigantic blast.  A sentinel class player character now dons an ablation tactical armor, which makes him/her very tough to kill.  An engineer class player character can launch a drone to aid him/her in battle.  An adept class player character can spawn micro-singularities around the enemies, annihilating them en masse. Tactical cloak, which renders a combatant invisible briefly, is available to an infiltrator class player character.  A vanguard class player character can dash around the battlefield with a new biotic power--the "biotic charge", which propels him/her forward at tremendous speed and force, to attack or evade the enemies.  There is no longer any class restriction in armor.  Medi-gel, used in the ME1 to regenerate health, is replaced with auto-regeneration, although the players still need it to cast the Unity reviving power.  (Note: auto-regeneration is also available in ME1, but only as an upgrade to the armors.)  THE DIALOGUE The dialogue wheel in ME1 is the most innovative dialogue system in all the games I have ever played.  When used probably, it delivers a continuous and seamless dialogue, and hence the movie-like quality of the game.  In ME2, the dialogue wheel is further improved.  A new "interrupt" system is introduced. When prompted by the players with the left or right trigger of the controller (of the Xbox 360), Commander Shepard can interrupt the dialogue with "heroic" or "hostile" action to get the answer he/she wants.  Furthermore, instead of the previous static camera position in ME1, the camera moves around during conversations in ME2, adding further cinematic effect to the game.  THE CHOICES Like in ME1, choices made by the players influence the outcome of the game in ME2.  For example, in ME1, on the planet Virmire, Commander Shepard (and hence the players), was called upon to decide which of the two squad mates he/she would rescue; the one left behind was consumed in a subsequent nuclear blast.  In the same manner, decisions of the players in ME2 throughout the game may eventually lead to the annihilation of the entire ground team in the final mission, including Commander Shepard, or the survival of every team member, or something in between. Players with a "dead" Shepard will not be able to import him/her into ME3. The same thing is true with a "dead" teammate.  They can play ME3 with a generic Shepard, but not "their" Shepard.   Furthermore, with Shepard killed, players can't return to the game world after the final mission and continue to play, for example, to complete a side quest, or to explore a new locale.  They will have to start a new game or reload with a previous save-file and replay part of the game for a different outcome.  This gives incentive to players to make sound decisions throughout the game, before heading into the final mission.  THE CERBERUS NETWORK The Cerberus Network is a cleverly designed in-game portal through which players can access "Downloadable Contents (DLCs)" from EA.    Players activate this network with a one-time access code, which is included in every new game purchase.  Game renters and used game buyers will have to pay for the code.  This arrangement is apparently a ploy by EA to combat the rental and used game market, which has been undermining retail sales of new games.  Players who access the network will receive the first DLC pack on January 26, 2010, the date on which the game is released in North America.  This first DLC introduces Zaeed, a rough and tumble mercenary who will join Shepard's elite team.  A future DLC will introduce the Hammerhead, a hover tank to replace the much-maligned Mako in ME1.  (Note: There is no driveable vehicle in the core game.) In addition, new missions and in-game items will be released to gamers by EA through this network.  CONCLUSION ME2 comes with 2 discs.  Players have to swap discs (twice per game) at some points. There are 90 voice actors playing 546 characters with over 30,000 lines of dialogue. New voice actors in ME2 include D.C. Douglas, Martin Sheen and Adam Baldwin.  In conclusion, ME2 is a role-playing game with the look and feel of a shooter.  It is a must-have game of the year.

Because my order on Amazon for this product was backordered for a month or more, I called all the local Best Buys until I found a WD TV Live that was not showing up on their "store availability" page and purchased it for $119 plus tax (oh how I missed Amazon when the tax was added on at my local store!).  The price on Amazon has gone all over the place the last few days, from $119 to $149.  I'm assuming we'll see it at $99 after the initial release period is over since several media players are now priced at that point.  I went home, unpacked the box and in my haste I didn't even see the installation CD that came with the unit.  (I just ran it now so I could tell you about it - it includes a utility which allows your computer to "see" the WD TV, as well as the manual and some other fluff).  I plugged the WDTV into an ethernet jack on my router, used the supplied cables to attach to my TV, plugged in the power cable and literally minutes later I was watching videos stored on my computer!  The WD TV immediately logged onto our computer network and saw both of our computers (Windows XP), and I was able to watch media stored on both.  Wow.  Very easy.  Then I navigated to Pandora, punched in my account information, and 30 seconds later was listening to my Pandora music stations.  Next stop was YouTube (another menu option), I plugged in my YouTube name and password, and was able to see my YouTube subscriptions.    I then went into the settings menu and clicked on "update firmware" just to make sure I had the latest firmware installed.  After about 5 seconds of the unit checking with Western Digital, it confirmed my firmware is up to date.  Again, very easy.  I was also able to register the unit from the onscreen display, and received a confirmation email.  I found the onscreen menus very logically laid out and easy to use.  Watching movies stored on my computer and accessing YouTube/Pandora was great - but I wanted to see if I could access Hulu.  So, I navigated to the "media server" menu and it saw my Tversity software program running on one computer.  I clicked on that and minutes later I was watching "Glee" (a program on ABC).  The only issue I ran into was that fast forward would sometimes cause the program to freeze and I would need to re-start.  Given that this media player is brand new and basically in what feels like a beta release, sold out just about everywhere, I'm assuming that a firmware upgrade in the coming weeks will fix that bug as well as any others I come across.  I tried a few other programs and was only able to replicate the issue intermittently.  However, pause caused no problems.  And, I don't expect Western Digital to support Tversity, which may be the root of the problem (vs the WD player) so I'm not taking off marks for that one issue.  I'm just happy I can watch a variety of shows streamed from Tversity on the WD TV.  (A google search on Tversity will take you to the download site for that wonderful free to try program).  My previous media server, the D-Link DSM-320 D-Link DSM-320 Wireless Media Player, Audio/Photo/Video, 802.11g , is not nearly as nice... I spent hours and hours and hours (days) configuring it and getting it to "see" my home network.  I also found the user menus to be very cumbersome with navigation almost an afterthought.  In contrast, the WD TV is a dream come true and definitely feels like the "next generation" of media servers.  I've tried a number of video and music formats, and they've all played with no problem (except for the fast forward issue above).  I watched a slide show of pictures stored on one of my computers.  All of this without reading a single manual or going to a single internet help forum.  Literally, plug and play.  So, overall, I'd say this is a strong unit, and I'm very happy with it.  Since I am reviewing the unit much sooner than I normally would, I do commit to the Amazon community that if I experience issues with the WD TV I'll return to update this review.  But based on my experience with other media servers and other hardware setups, I think this is a winner.  Highly recommended.  Hope this helps!   UPDATE 11/12/2009:  Almost a month later and I'm 1000% happy with this player... no issues.  Works great... fast..great interface... I'm going to give one or two of these as holiday presents this year.  I've replaced my DVR on my second TV and no longer pay the cable company $14 per month for a DVR... this little gizmo is going to pay for itself!  LAST UPDATE 12/5/2009: I was experiencing video freezing with Hulu using the Tversity software on my computer... I switched to Playon and am really glad I did!  Flawless performance on Hulu streaming and TONS of content (i.e. you can watch tons of old TV shows like Dynasty and Mary Tyler Moore).  Still very happy with this unit.  I do agree with other  reviewers - it would be nice if remote had a volume control, and some of the navigation screens are a bit "clunky" but overall very happy.

The Timex seemed to work perfectly.  It was consistent first with my resting pulse rate.  And at the gym the Star Trec Treadmill picked up the signal and registered the same as it did yesterday when I didn't have the Timex unit.    I'm 70 years old.  It was really great to NOT have to grab the treadmill sensors with both hands to check my pulse while jogging 6+MPH.   The new Star Trec treadmill picked up the Timex signal and displayed my heart rate so I didn't even have to look at the watch.  Of course it comes in handy on the rowing machine and the torso machine, acting as an incentive to push to my maximum heart rate.    It may be that the watch battery (or more likely the sensor battery) will run down after a couple of months of daily use.  I don't actually know how long the batteries will last or how resilient the unit is to abuse.   I hope it will outlast the cheap but comfortable plastic watch band.  Now that I have used it once I don't want to jog, bicycle, or go the gym without it.

I don't know whether we blew a speaker (which we've done on every other stereo and car we've owned) or whether it was just the tiny, tinny speakers in the TV. (Time out for pet peeve: We paid a LOT of money for this TV 2 years ago; you'd think they could put decent speakers in it. OK, back in) He was always asking me what people had said. I wasn't sure one of these would 'fix' it, but it did. We pulled it out of the box and plugged one cable into the wall for power and one into the TV for audio (actually 2 together, you know how they do left and right, red and yellow). We turned the TV speakers off and started enjoying TV immediately. Then my son insisted that we had to use the subwoofer. I thought extra noise was part of our problem and didn't want to add anything more. We plugged it into power and placed it behind my husband's chair. Wonderful. You don't actually hear stuff from this, more like you feel the sound. And this woofer is wireless, so other than needing power, you can put it ANYWHERE in the room. Apparently it's not like the 3.1/5.1/7.1 speakers where placement is so critical (at least according to those audiophiles). And it only took a few seconds to train our remote to drive it. You hold down a button and count the blinks. When it reaches 3 or something it's programmed.  So, easy setup of soundbar, able to use existing remote, and decent looking design. What's not to love.

Not only do her songs have less cheesy lines in them, but you can tell just by looking at her that she is more mature.  I found this album to be a little depressing because there aren't too many cheerful, upbeat songs like there were on Let Go, but still a cool pop/rock album!  Here are my ratings for each song:  1. Take Me Away-5/5.  This song has a hard rock beat, and is somewhat like "Losing Grip", the song that started off Let Go.  It is about just wanting to get away from all the pain and suffering being felt inside.  2. Together-4/5.  Avril's vocals in the chorus have a rather annoingly high pitch, but this song is still a good one.  In this song, Avril talks about not feeling "together" with her boyfriend.   3. Don't Tell Me-5/5.  One of my favorite songs on this album.  It has a rather mature subject, and is not exactly the most appropriate for younger kids.    4. He Wasn't-3/5.  The "Sk8r Boi" of Under My Skin, "He Wasn't" is really upbeat, and the lyrics are kind of cheesy in some parts.  In this song, Avril sings about the boy she likes turning out to be someone completely different from what she thought he would be.  5. How Does It Feel-3/5.  This song is slow, but Avril's vocals sound pretty good in it.  That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.  It is about wondering how other people view the world.  6. My Happy Ending-5/5.  Another of my favorites on this album.  It has a great beat, and catchy lyrics.  It is about an "UN-Happy Ending" with a boy.  Note that there is a kind of big cussword in the part after the first chorus.  7. Nobody's Home-4/5.  I guess this is the song I should be talking about the most, since Amazon won't let you listen to a clip of it on this album.  It is a kind of sad song about a girl who's been misguided, and who is alone and depressed.  The beat is good, and Avril's voice sounds nice.   8. Forgotten-5/5.  This song starts out in an eerie sort of way, then turns into hard rock and loud vocals.  This is yet another of my favorite songs.  It is about, of course, being forgotten and left behind.  9. Who Knows-3/5.  This song has a good beat, and is about making your dreams come true.  10. Fall To Pieces-3/5.  This song is slightly better then "Who Knows", in my opinion, although it sounds rather similar to it.  It is a love song, and Avril's vocals sound pretty good in it.  11. Freak Out-5/5.  This song sounds like one that would end a really good movie, or be the favorite on the movie soundtrack.  It has a good beat, and catchy lyrics.  I used to not like it, but yes, it is now ANOTHER of my favorite songs on this album.  It is about letting loose.  12. Slipped Away-5/5.  This is a sad song Avril wrote about when her grandpa died.  The beat is nice, though slow, the lyrics are good, and Avril's vocals sound great.  If you're easily depressed/disturbed then you might not like this song, though.  By averaging, I got the overall rating of 4 stars for this album, which is better then the overall rating I got for Let Go.  I would suggest listening to clips of the songs here on Amazon before purchasing, though.

Is it vastly different than (6.0 or 7.0) and should this be my digital photo editing and organizing software of choice? I will cover the main points of the changes from Version 6.0 and 7.0 in this review. I have also reviewed Photoshop Premiere Elements 8  which is the video editor, and comes as a package option with Photoshop Elements 8.  	 Photoshop Elements has two components-- an editor, where you do your digital picture manipulation, and a file organizer or album where you store and retrieve your images. The interface for the editor is the same whether or not you use Mac or Windows, so if you are switching from one OS (say, MAC's at school, Windows at home) you will be very comfortable with Photoshop Elements. Where the systems differ, however, is in the file organizer and this is understandable; the Organizer function involves organizing and retrieving files, so this is going to be different depending on your computer operating system.   Since I don't have access to a MAC, and since I don't know much about them, I'm going to be reviewing the Windows version only from here on in this review. For your information, I'm currently using Windows Vista 64 Home Premium Edition.   My computer system used for this test is an HP Pavilion with an AMD Athlon 64X2 2.70 Dual Core CPU 5200+. I have 4 GB of RAM. The Video card is NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 wtih 128 MB of video memory.  This is an on-board video card (on the motherboard) and if you are doing heavy image work, and video, you might want a separate, more capable video card.  Minimum PC Requirements:  Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7  1.6GHz or faster processor 1GB RAM  (MINIMUM means MINIMUM; you really will need 2GB of ram to be comfy) 2GB available hard disk space Microsoft DirectX 9 Color monitor with 16-bit color video card   Internet Access for online features and help   One immediate, small but great change from Version 7.0 is that when the software is initially booted up, the Welcome Screen is rearranged; on the left side: simple buttons EDIT or ORGANIZE. On the right, access to tutorials and underneath, info on your Photoshop online account (space available, links to your personal URL and online organizer.)  Version 7.0 had tab buttons along the top of the welcome screen and was visually more confusing. THIS IS A GREAT IMPROVEMENT. THANK YOU.   A big change from Version 6.0 is the workspace, which is now dark gray in color (I actually don't like this--the gray is depressing, but I understand visually it is far less distracting and lets you focus on your editing job.)  The workspace is now adjustable. However, if you are a change-o-phobic or just habit-bound, you can return the settings to look and feel like previous versions, for example, the fixed-window workspace of Version 6.0 can be retrieved in the Application Frame in the preferences window.  There are other big changes, mainly the organizer, the online content, the personal online space and some editing tools; more about these further on in this review.   In addition to the change to the Welcome Screen, there are changes to the interface where you access your tools. The palettes have been renamed as "panels" so I got confused a bit again. I've been using Palettes for years with editing software; palettes of filters, layers, colors. So, now, they are PANELS, and you can do this right in the panel itself at the bottom. This is also a significant change from Version 6.0 (7.0 does have it.) The big change to 7.0 however, is that the layer controls are now their own panel below the Layers panel. The old dialog boxes are being replaced by these drop-down panels.   	 Getting down to brass tacks; the biggest change from 6.0 to either version 7.0 or now 8.0 by far, is the Organizer. Not only is there an automatic "organize my images for me" feature, but there is an optional online storage feature that has many uses.  The main change from 7.0 to 8.0 has to do with an improved ability to add key word tags and to manage your  media.  If media management is an issue for you, this upgrade will be worth your while.   Another big change in Version 8.0: do you open multiple files at a single session? (I often download a photo session from say, a parade or one event.) Beforehand, you'd have to go to the file list in "Open Files"  and pick which ones or all the ones you want, and try to scroll through them at the bottom to find the photo you want. Now you can open multiple files and use tabs to switch between them. This is huge. If you don't like point-and-click, you can employ a keyboard shortcut of Command-~ (tilde) to page through the open files.  The main change to Version 8.0 is the Organizer. When you boot up the software and have those choices, Edit or Organize, initially you are asked to set up an online account at Photoshop.com. You don't HAVE to do this. And you are then asked if you want to organize your photos, and this is the real advantage; the system combs through your hard drive and pulls up your images, and organizes them (like Picasa and other organizing programs) into a set of albums. The last six months are available with a single click, or you can organize by other means.   If you key-word tag your photos when saving them, and use the Smart Tags (everything from photo quality (good, bad, over, underexposed, face, etc) to event tags, you can create albums and quickly export them to DVD,CD, online albums, or hard drive. If you do a lot of image work and don't want your main hard drive cluttered with images, or if you want to back up your images onto an external drive, this is very handy.  The organizer is one major reason to move from 6.0 to 8.0. Organizing a large number of photographs is made seamless and easy with the organizer that appeared in Version 7.0. I didnt think Id need it, but I do need it and I use it. In fact, I need to get better at using the tag feature. This is very good for the increasingly difficult task of finding and retrieving older photos.     You get 2GB free storage online at Adobe Photoshop.com's site, so if you sign up (as is suggested in the Welcome Screen), you can have an offsite, online backup. If 2GB is not enough storage for you, you can pay for Plus membership. Plus Membership starts at around twenty bucks (at this time) and you can go from 20GBmb (about 4 hours of video storage) to 40, 100, 250 or 500GB of storage, with prices rising accordingly. There are other perks such as advanced tutorials, and some bonus art and video effects, but the main reason for upgrading from free is to obtain much more online storage.  I used some of the themes for the slide show and there are a few included, so the temptation is very strong to spring for the extra twenty bucks, get the ten-fold increase in storage (easy to fill it up) as well as the larger selection of themes. If you use Premiere, the adjunct video editing, you get increased storage for videos, and movie theme materials for "instant movies." I will be reviewing Premiere 8.0 separately, but you can see that if you intend to use the complete image-plus-video package, you probably will want a Plus membership. I was surprised to find out (me, the minimalist) that I did also want the upgrade. Film buffs and Youtube fanatics will want the extra storage; video takes a lot of space, and you are permitted to upload a video of up to 2GB with basic membership.   In version 7.0, Adobe introduced a much-improved Photomerge funtion. I use this function a lot to make composite photos as well as panoramas and other interesting landscape creations and group photos. I was not happy with the previous Photomerge in versions 6.0 and prior, but I used it a lot as a shortcut to cut-and-paste multiple images to make a composite. Version 8.0 improves Photomerge and adds a very interesting and useful feature: you can combine several exposures to create the "perfect" digital exposure. Take one shot with flash and one without. (Yes, the no-flash shot is too dark; the flash shot is sometimes washed-out or the shadows look funny.) Using PhotomMerge Exposure, you can get a new, improved "best-of-both-worlds" photograph. Here's my take: if you have Version 7.0 and you do a lot of photography, this is worth the upgrade alone.   Two new editing tools, Recompose and Smart Brush, tools also are slick ways to merge and fix photos with a lot less fiddling around, or by using some smarts built into the software. For example, you can reformat a wide photograph, remove a lot of blank space and recompose it to have the figures closer together, but not distorted. I used to do this by a very involved cut-and-paste procedure, copying figures I wanted to move and covering over unsightly elements like road signs or utility poles; this is a lot faster though I still need to do some clever editing myself if a pole appears "growing" out of the top of a subject's head (a huge photographic boo-boo) or if there is some goofy kid mooning you or mugging a funny face in the background of the shot (I shouldn't be telling you this, but a fun way to ruin someone's vacation photograph is to sneak into the background as they compose their award-winning photo of the Eifel Tower or Mount Rushmore and cross your eyes and stick out your tongue. Kind of a human version of that intruding squirrel of internet fame.)  Using Recompose, you can remove these offensive things more easily.   There are templates to make cards, calendars, frames and other artwork. I am not into that kind of thing, but it's there for those of you who do scrapbooking, especially digital scrapbooking or who make your own birthday cards or Christmas newsletters. I used the slideshow template and I loved it. I wanted more...but the themes as I mentioned previously, are limited in the basic, included online edition. You have to spring for Plus membership to expand those selections of themes.   No major changes to the filters. Pretty much the same as Version 6.0, with the changes to controlling the interface as I mentioned before. The biggest change to filters is in the smart brushes for photographs. I have been using the filters a great deal ever since Elements was introduced, to pre-compose paintings from my digital photos. They seem pretty much the same as in earlier versions though the adjustments are now easier to manipulate in the Filter Gallery.    This question comes up all the time: is 8.0 FASTER??? I didn't notice any difference loading 8.0 and 7.0. Definitely, versions 7.0 and 8.0 are much faster to load than 6.0, at least with my computer.    Re tutorials, manuals and help; as usual, help is online content though a pamphlet on Getting Started comes with the box of software. In addition to the online content for help, there is a "Tips and Tricks" hyperlink in the Welcome Screen (lower right). This takes you online to a web page with tutorials. The tutorials include what's new in Version 8.0, various help for video editing (this will be covered in my review of Premiere Version 8.0.) You can search for other tutorials, and even submit your own. Tutorials have a rating on the right (one to five stars.) When you click on a particular tutorial, you will see the author, a way to favorite it for future reference, and on the right, you can add your own rating of it.   Summary:  Version 8.0 has a few great new improvements over Version 7.0. It is not vastly different than 7.0 but the Recompose, PhotomMerge Exposure and some of the adjustments to the panels are advanced enough to make this a significant improvement if you like to do digital photography. It is quite different from Version 6.0 so if you have not upgraded and these features appeal to you, I think it would be well worth it to get the improved organizer and the improved tools. 	  Recommendation: If you are on 6.0 or earlier versions and your PC meets the minimum requirements, do upgrade to 8.0. If you are on Version 7.0 and employ the media organization, upgrade to 8.0  			  Joanna Daneman

I don't regularly watch Nancy Grace on TV but I've caught it a few times when I was channel surfing.  Like when I've caught her on TV, I was glued to the book from the very beginning.  This book gives plenty of visual details and the writing flows easily.  It usually takes me a bit of time to warm up to a book and get to know the characters but this one had me from page one.  It is a quick read being only about 350 or so pages so to me it is like a good suspense thriller movie.  I am always looking for reading material to keep me on the treadmill and this fit the bill.   I liked it!
like	0	I first read this book when I was 16, and I've received a lot of Dianetics auditing since then. I also re-read it twice. However, I never had my own copy (used friends') so I decided to pick up my own book from Amazon today.   I was shocked to see the vast morass of negative reviews on this book! It seems to be a whole bunch of people who are biased against Hubbard and Scientology in general. They obviously have limited comprehension of the material because their reviews seem to have more to do with their opinions of Hubbard and Scientology than they do of Dianetics.  I personally have had a lot of fun with Dianetics therapy and I believe I've improved myself a lot, too. After reading this book I was practically itching to try it. Since then I've had dozens of hours "in the chair" both auditing and as a preclear on Dianetics. The book makes it easy! Plus, the edition I had gave you a "how-to" card which laid out all the steps for you in summarized form. I can only hope this newer edition has the same thing.   It's likely my review won't even be read by many, as the first several pages of reviews are all negative. However, if you've slogged through them because you believe someone MUST have had something nice to say about it - take a chance on this book. I and many of my friends will vouch for it in a heartbeat.

Filled with dozens, maybe hundreds, of specific examples of charitable individuals and successful grassroots programs, it argues -- in fact, proves -- that you don't have to be a big shot to make the world a better place. Clinton clearly believes in what he writes; the book is passionate and powerful on topics that, in other hands, would be detached and dull.   Besides the subject matter, what I liked best about the book is its organization. Written so you don't have to read it all at once, it breaks down philanthropy into six different categories, and gives each its own chapter. Those are:  * Giving time * Giving things * Giving skills  * Giving "gifts of reconciliation and new beginnings" (citing everything from the efforts of Nelson Mandela to PeacePlayers International, a group that sets up basketball leagues in the Middle East) * Giving gifts that keep on giving (such as the work of Heifer International, which gives millions of poor farmers free cows -- as long as they agree to donate one its first offspring to someone else) * Giving to good ideas  Clinton also includes descriptions of some successful charitable programs that are easy to use as model strategies for your own ideas, illustrates how businesses can make money out of acting in the public interest, and explains his views on what roles governments (not just Washington, but cities and states) can play.   In the last chapter, titled "How Much Should You Give and Why," he argues that if the rich would donate five percent of their incomes to humanitarian causes, the rest of society would give even more, and that one reason to be generous and public spirited is simply that it makes you feel good. "Who's happier?" he writes. "The uniters or the dividers? The builders or the breakers? The givers or the takers? I think you know the answer."  Regardless of your political views, if you're a charitable person and seriously want to make a difference in the world, this is a must-read. You'll come away from it not only inspired, but with plenty of ideas on how to accomplish your goals.

I am a photographer too, so I have tons of Photos (about 160GB), Videos, Software, Movies and Documentaries. I was looking for a simple external hard drive without any backup software included, I am smart enough to do manual incremental backups with file tree structure intact (I use GOODSYNC to backup, its very simple and easy to use and free).       I have looked at many many external HDDs and narrowed down to two models "Samsung Story 1TB - very good one too" and this one (I wanted it to be cheap too - got this for $85 on [...]). I did not go with other WD models because of their annoying Backup Software.       Coming to the WD Elements 1TB: Its much smaller than I expected. It is dead silent, I had to touch it to convince myself that it was running, when I first turned it on. Its not too heavy either. The indicator light is placed at the rear, which is a very good thing (I find these LED's annoying, especially at night).       After I did the first setup, I copied 383GB of data (931GB was total space). It took about 4hr 47min, speed varied between 20MBps to 37MBps. This is pretty good speed for USB 2.0. It was just a bit warm (my old segate hard drive would be very very hot for this amount of data transfer).       I would recommend it to beginners or pros alike. I am very happy with this purchase!   UPDATE:  After about three months of heavy usage, it never gave up on me. Its still dead silent and works flawlessly. It never got even warm!!  Follow these steps to get GOODSYNC for FREE:  In the beginning GOODSYNC was free, later they made a paid version as it gained popularity..  but there is a way to get PRO version for free...  1. go to good sync website 2. signup for a trial offer and you get PRO serial for free (I signed up for eMusic trial) 3. Once you get the serial, end the subscription before the trial expires...

If you are from Eastern Europe or like Eastern European cuisine, you will really appreciate this honey. It is very dark and has that strong noble taste and smell I associate with good quality honey.  If you like sugary sweet clover or alfalfa honey (bright yellow substance that does not crystallize, which chain supermarkets sell in plastic bottles), this honey is not for you.

Carrying around a slippery, glass-fronted device, I was primarily looking for a case that would provide good energy dissipation in the inevitable event that I drop-kick it across a room when fumbling for keys.  As such, an unyielding hardshell case just wasn't ideal.  The fitment, bracing, and silicone material of the Impact are a well-thought-out means of limiting shock intensity (although I thankfully haven't tested it to any considerable extent).   The Impact fits the phone snugly, provides a good textured grip for the hand, and doesn't drown out the mic and earpiece like poorly-fitted units. All slides and buttons are easily accessible - perhaps even more so than without case since my hand isn't slipping all over the glossy shell.  Relatedly, the Impact adds very little size to the phone and weighs next to nothing. The included screen protector works great too - I'd heard of rainbow refractions and a slightly-milky appearance, but cleaning the surface well beforehand and working carefully resulted in a crystal-clear application.  Can't tell it's even in place.  No complaints on that front. I could do without the circular port on the back of the case, but it does nothing to harm structural integrity and it displays my MS sticker effectively. ;) It will certainly do the same for the Apple logo, however!  The thickness of the silicone protects it from most direct scratchin' contact. My second option in terms of cases was the Otterbox Defender, but I felt the Impact would suffice for day-to-day protection, and thus far this has certainly proven to be true.

like	0	I am writing this review, because every review on here seems to be about the author and his biases and not about the BOOK itself. Let me first say that I am an avid reader. I read everything from Stephenie Meyer to Bertrand Russell, Chuck Palahniuk to Freakonomics.  I read 3-5 books per week, fiction and non-fiction alike.   I knew very little about Glenn Beck before I purchased this book. Of course I had heard his name, and that he was a radio personality, but that's about it. I read a little about him before beginning the book, learning that he is a "conservative libertarian."  With that being said, it didn't really matter to me, a good book is a good book, no matter the political implications or insinuations.   About the book: The plot was weak, it could have used a lot less quoting and preaching and a lot more character development and background. I found myself being thrown into a whole lot of speeches and little narrative or story development.  The original character descriptions were good, but I found myself wanting to know more about them, who they were really, where they came from, and what they were thinking. The protagonist of this story was the only character that was explored deeper than a name, physical description, and a little about their backgrounds. I wanted to know more about them ESPECIALLY what they were thinking.   The writing was a little below average. Mr. Beck just isn't that good of a story teller, I found myself drifting through the quotes and preaching, wanting them to be over so the story could continue...which it never really did. There was never a climax in the story, and the ending left a lot to be desired.   You would have expected to learn a lot more of the elder Mr. Gardner(the main character's father) before the last chapter. Additionally, I felt that it ended without anything being solved. It just kind of ended in what I would think of as the middle of the story.   All in all this was not worth the day and a half I put into reading it, and I suggest if Mr. Beck wants to share his political ideology, he stick to non-fiction. I would be happy to read it, and would probably enjoy it.  Why write a fiction book, when really all you want to do is write a book of facts regarding the corruption of our country? That's what we really need to hear and read...hiding all of that in the guise of a fiction story(dubbed a thriller, no less) is disappointing to those of us who want to read a good novel.    ***NOTE: For all of you who are going to call me a biased liberal hippie, I am a former employee and lifetime member of the National Rifle Association(thanks to Mr. Beck for the kudos in the book), and a member of the libertarian party.

The first part of this review will focus solely on the Asus UL80VT-A1 and the second part of this review will compare it with my experience with the Dell Studio 14z and the HP dm3z.   ASUS UL80VT-A1 DETAILED REVIEW  First and foremost, let me say that I ordered the UL80VT-A1 because I thought it was simply an awesome idea to have switchable graphics in a laptop because you get excellent battery life + excellent performance when needed. There were no reviews of the UL80VT out when I purchased it, so I purchased the UL80VT-A1 from [...], which has a 100 percent refund on purchases just in case things didn't work out with me and the new lady.   While I was waiting to recieve the laptop in the mail, I read a review over at [...]. Oh boy, was I disappointed considering all the bad things the reviewer had to say about it (i.e. bad keyboard, bad track pad, horrible build quality, poor gaming performance). Needless to say, I had second thoughts about even opening up the Asus UL80VT-A1 because I didn't think it was worth my time considering the all the problems the reviewer had with his review model.   So that morning I got my HP dm3z in the mail and was really excited about how incredibly beautiful the laptop was. It is definitely sexier (in my opinion) than every other ultraportable out there, including the Macbook Pro 13" and HP Envy 13. I'll get to the dm3z a little later... either way, my first impression led me to believe that I'd probably be keeping the dm3z and just returning the Asus. When the Asus came in the mail, I wasn't even watching for it like I had been the dm3z. But I did take it upstairs and opened it up. (Unboxing video coming soon...)   FIRST IMPRESSIONS  My first impression was astoundingly contradictory to review I had read. I picked it up, squeezed it, pushed on the keyboard, which had minimal flex that wasn't noticeable to me when typing. My other first impressions were just how well the trackpad worked. The two finger scroll worked flawlessly (though it isn't as smooth of a scroll as Apple's, it functions equally responsively and is just as useful).   GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE - Rating 9/10  Over the last view days, I've been taking the UL80VT-A1 out for spin in a series of gaming tests. The first game I tested was the ever popular Counter-Strike: Source. I was astounded by the computer's ability to put out 150 FPS in the stress test at native resolution of 1366x768. I had been expecting to get closer to 80-100 FPS. I then tested it with 4x AA on, and it resulted in 99 FPS, which is phenomenal considering that AA usually cripple weaker graphics cards like the Nvidia 210M.   I was eager to test out the UL80VT's performance in some of the latest games because of the previous review I had read that had denounced its ability to play modern games. I had recently purchased Batman: Arkham Asylum. I loaded it up with the default settings, which were set on Very High at native 1366x768 resolution. Game play was moderately smooth and playable, but it was also noticably choppy at times with those settings (26 FPS average in the video stress test), so I dropped the settings down to medium. This time the Asus got 40 FPS average in the video stress test, and the game play was perfectly playable and smooth.   I then downloaded Team Fortress 2. It has been known to give ultraportable gaming machines a tough time due to its high shader requirements. When playing, I averaged about 50-60 FPS at native resolution with everything on High with no AA. I noticed drops down to 30 FPS when in heavy action, but it was not too disruptive to game play. I don't think it went below 30 FPS during the time I played.   After hearing claims that Asus UL80VT could not run Need For Speed: Shift well. I downloaded the demo to see if these claims were true. Fortunately, they were not. I was able to achieve playable frame rates, though it was a little choopy with the default settings, which had the screen at 1024x768 resolution and everything else up in detail. I tried changing the settings, but after changing the settings to lower the resolution to 800x600, the game repeatedly gave me an error and crashed right as the race was about to start. Unfortunately, I was not able to do a formal test, but it was clear that the game was getting at least 30 FPS at 800x600 resolution with texture settings on High. I would expect the game to be very playable as long as you are content with 800x600 (or maybe slightly better res) and medium settings.   I also managed to squeeze in a little play time in Protoype, another recent game that was released earlier this year. It played very smoothly at the default 1280x720 (which was the max res for some reason) and on the default medium settings.   Another game I was able to try was Call of Duty: World at War, which has identical specs to the latest Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. People will be glad to know that I was able to achieve 35-40 FPS constant at native resolution 1366x768 with texture settings on "normal" (except for "shader settings" which I set to "low"). I also turned off all of the extra graphical features, which didn't make much of a difference in visuals anyway.   In conclusion regarding the gaming peformance of this ultraportable laptop, it has excellent performance and handles most modern games fluidly at native resolution.   BATTERY LIFE - Rating 10/10  Yesterday, I used the laptop for 3 hours early in the morning with wifi on and brightness up. Later that day, I used it for about 15 minutes running Batman: AA. I then used it about 7 hours more with brightness at about 20% (2.5 hours with wifi on and 4.5 with it off). In total the laptop lasted me 10.25 hours between a mixture of wifi, gaming, and note taking/paper writing. I was extremely happy to get this excellent of performance out of it. This was precisely what I was looking for in terms of battery life.  BUILD QUALITY - Rating 6/10  My initial impression was that the build quality was just average--not great, but nothing bad about it either, but now after having it for a couple days, I now agree with Charles' review about some of the issues with build quality. Yesterday morning when I was typing, I noticed that when I pressed down on the front edge of the left palm rest it squeaked annoyingly (it hadn't pressed down on this part of the laptop when it was on a hard surface yet because it had always been on my laptop up until this point).   I began squeezing the front edge and noticed that top part of the chassis isn't cemented to the bottom part of the chassis very well so that when you put pressure on it (such as when you rest your palm on it) it made a noise. I tried placing about an inch long piece of scotch tape across the part that was sqeaking, and the squeaking went away completely. It was disappointing to find this because it was the first issue with the build quality. Also, I now understand what Charles meant when he said that when he pressed in the center of the laptop it causes the bottom of the laptop to touch the surface it is resting on...   It's not if you press in the middle of the keyboard like I had thought Charles had said (my bad!!)... it's if you press on the trackpad buttons (like Charles had really said), he was right that you can feel the laptop touch the surface it is resting on, but the thing Charles was wrong about is that it isn't the bottom of the laptop touching the surface below it... it's a little "support peg/foot" that protrudes from the bottom of the laptop about 1/10" of an inch.   The overall chassis does flex a tad, but it is just the peg touching, and the peg is maybe moving 1/16" of an inch tops (probably less). So yes, the chassis does flex just a hair, but not as bad as the review makes it sound (I think the review should be updated with this information personally).  I am thinking about putting a drop of super glue on the edge of the left palm rest to keep it from squeaking. I'm pretty sure it would work without a hitch unless you put too much glue and then tried to take the casing apart and wasn't able to. I figure it wouldn't void the 1 year accidental warranty but maybe the 2 year standard warranty if they figured out what I did. I'm not sure though... I figure you can always "cut through" the glue so that the chassis can be opened if you needed to send it in for repairs.  I also noticed that the entire surface (including the aluminum top) acquires fingerprints. I was disappointed that the aluminum top also was prone to oils from my fingers.   HEAT MANAGEMENT - Rating 10/10  The heat on this bad-boy is hardly noticeable. I think more heat is generated because it is restricting the airflow over your lap more than anything. Whenever my lap started to feel a little warm, I would feel the bottom of the laptop but the bottom of the laptop never got hot. It was always just the fact that my legs weren't getting as much air to cool them down.   I was also able to play Batman:AA while on my lap just fine, though it was starting to be mildly uncomfortable by the time 30 mins rolled around. Still, as far as gaming on the lap goes, I think it would be doable, and far more doable than on any other laptop I have ever tried.   This laptop is by far the coolest running laptop I have ever owned (I've owned about 14 different laptops...). For this reason, I give it a 10/10 in heat management.   KEYBOARD - Rating 8/10  Overall, I find the keyboard to be a little above average. I do not like the fact that there are no keys dedicated to playing and pausing music. To access media controls, you must hold the FN button down and tap the arrow keys (down arrow = play/pause). I do not notice any flex when typing. The primary concern that I had was from the squeaky palm rest edge when typing. After I fixed that issue, the keyboard became quite pleasant to use.   TRACK PAD - Rating 9/10  I find the track pad to be the best track pad I have ever used on a PC. It does have a glossy surface, but I did not find that the surface was not nearly as sticky as the surface on many HPs (including the dm3z). I also found the trackpad to be responsive and that the multitouch gestures such as two-finger scrolling to work perfectly nearly every time.   The ELAN touch pad has configurable options to enable you to change the sensitivity of the two-finger scroll as well as enable you to use two and three finger taps to do customizable actions. I have my two-finger tap to do a right click and my three-finger tap to show my desktop.   My only complaint regarding the touch pad is that the uni-button. The uni-button looks like only one button, but has a left side and right side that makes up two buttons. When the uni-button was pressed towards the middle, it was very difficult to click, but if you pressed it near the ends the button became more usable. This was also the case with the Acer Timeline 4810t that I had owned for some time. I have found that the tap to click function is very usable, especially since I can just use two fingers if I need to right click. Therefore, I hardly use the button anymore anyway. My system works just fine.   OVERALL VERDICT - Rating 9/10  Despite its (fixable) flaws in build quality and poor touch pad button (again just use "tap to click" instead), I'm still impressed with laptop and can definitely recommend it to friends who aren't particularly picky about build quality. The UL80VT-A1 will provide the performance most casual gamers want in a portable package that has a very long battery life and is inexpensive compared to similar models. [Oh, wait, scratch that...  There has never been anything like the UL80VT-A1 to ever come out before... except maybe the Acer Timeline 3810TG that had switchable graphics, but that computer was only available in the UK. ]  COMPARED TO THE COMPETITION (DELL STUDIO 14Z and HP DM3Z)  I have now owned a Dell Studio 14z for about two months. I also purchased a HP dm3z, which I had originally planned on writing a review of but I don't know if I'll find the time. Maybe I'll just do a video review...   Anyway, the HP dm3z initially impressed me tremendously with its fantastic metal looks and thin profile. However, two issues became immediately apparent that prevented me from considering the laptop further: the HP dm3z produced a tremendous amount of heat even while just idling (the bottom got roasting hot while playing games... though the palm rests stayed pretty cool) and I quickly became frustrated by track pad lag and malfunctioning two-finger scrolling. The problem with the two finger scroll is due to the fact that it does not always register that you are actually using two fingers, therefore, it thinks you only have one finger down and shoots your mouse all the way across the screen where you didn't want it to go.   Beside the two-finger scroll I noticed minimal track pad lag (though there was lag). The track pad was definitely usable and should not prevent someone entirely from purchasing it for that sole reason, but after trying out the UL80VT's track pad and comparing the two. It was night and day. The UL80VT's was immediately responsive and the two-finger scrolling worked perfectly pretty much all the time. I have sorely missed two-finger scrolling since getting rid of my Macbook Pro a year ago. I am very glad that PCs are starting to make it standard on the majority of notebooks today. Unfortunately, the HP dm3z did not have good enough drivers to make the two-finger scrolling worthwhile.   One thing that I really liked about the dm3z is that it had an excellent keyboard with zero flex and it included media control buttons for the function keys (like Dell Studio 14z). I would definitely recommend the dm3z to people as long as you understand that it is going to produce a lot of heat (especially while watching video/playing games), the track pad is just going to be so-so, and you aren't going to achieve the same battery life you would if you went with the UL80VT (unless you went with the intel version with integrated graphics).   I began searching for a new laptop shortly after I found paint chipping on my Dell Studio 14z. It was frustrating since I try to take excellent care of my laptops and chipped paint tends to bring the resale value of laptops down tremendously. All in all, I found my experience with the 14z to be a good one and would recommend the laptop to someone who has a strict budget and can't afford a UL80VT.   With the dell, I was typically able to get about 3.5-4.5 hours of battery life (8-cell in windows 7) while surfing the internet-writing documents. The HP dm3z seems to get about 4.5 hrs of web surfing time. The Asus literally doubles the length of my time I am going to be away from the wall (with both the HP and the Dell...).   My primary complaints with the Dell Studio 14z were related to the build quality (paint chipping and noticeable keyboard flex that was causing me discomfort). I loved the back-lit keyboard and will miss that feature on the UL80VT, though I am a touch typist so it will make little difference in terms of actual functionality.   I love the fact that my UL80VT has a DVD-RW because I like to watch DVDs at Starbucks that I rent from Redbox. I couldn't do that with the 14z because it lacked an optical drive, but I can do that with the Asus.   It should also be noted that the UL80VT has a better screen than both the Dell and the HP (in my opinion).   IN CONCLUSION  After I discovered the flex, I began contemplating switching over to a Macbook Pro 13". So I went to my local Best Buy to compare sizes, keyboard, touchpad, etc... I got to the store and there was a bestbuy sales guy there that I got to know pretty well when I bought my Dell Studio 14z. I began explaining to him how the 14z hadn't met my needs due to a sucky touch pad and paint chipping off for no reason, etc. I pulled my UL80VT out of my bag and explain to him the features of the laptop (i.e. switchable graphics, 10 hour battery life). I loaded up Batman Arkham Asylum and he was amazed that it played smoothly at native resolution. I showed him squeaky palm rest and explained to him I was considering getting a 13" Macbook Pro. He responded pretty quickly that he didn't think that apple would have anything that would be an upgrade from this so just recommended that I just stick with the Asus... (lol and he's a sales guy that is supposed to sell laptops for best buy, not recommend for me not to buy them... lol)  I agree with the guy at Best Buy. Apple's got nothing on the Asus UL80VT... except maybe better build quality, poorer performance, and a $500 dollar increase in price. Hint: get the Asus, unless build quality is of utmost importance to you.  I'm sorry that this review was so scatter-brained. I like to keep things more organized, but I also just wanted to get this review posted!!

I enjoyed her two British sidekicks who unfortunately mostly just stay in Croft Manor. You'll recognize Croft's butler from the British series 'Red Dwarf.'  Both he and Bryce do a stand-up job. The sets are all around the world, a bit like a Bond movie, which no doubt increased the production cost. My only complaint is the director or producer (or both) seemed to take the plot way too seriously, they should have had more fun with this. They did on occasion achieve this, such as the scene where Croft asks the Templar #2 guy, "Who sits here? I don't think you sit here."  Pretty cheeky, there should have been more humor like this. Not the Roger Moore/James Bond tongue in cheek, but something funny yet ironic.  The DVD version had tons of extra, all of which are watching.  I hv not seen the Blu Ray version but recommend the DVD version. A bit like Bond, but with popcorn plot, not that Bond plots could be taken any more seriously.

With one in hand and actually using the device, I can honestly say it is an excellent, gorgeous, piece of hardware. The biggest flaw, it weighs a ton. The weight doesn't sound like a bad thing, but after I held this device in both hands while laying down, my arms got sore. It's a small thing, but you should be aware that it is heavy.  Set up was super simple. Connect the unit to your computer, run iTunes, follow the wizard. About 5 minutes later the iPad is set up and activated. The wizard does call it an iPhone for some strange reason. If you have an iPhone already, the set up is a bit easier. It will inherit most of your settings.  Once activated, you have to unplug the unit and then go through the settings application to set up your wireless network and a variety of other settings. All pretty obvious, top to bottom, essentially all the same as the iPhone.   Do note that the charger is a 10W charger - much larger and different from the iPhone's 5W charger. So you'll have to use that charger. There is a big negative, you'll have to cart around that charger, most USB ports will not charge this device. My beast of a PC has plently of power on all the USB ports, and it will not charge my iPad. External battery packs will work with no trouble charging, or extending the use.  Battery life - I ran video, downloaded a ton of apps, and played with this thing for a solid 2 hours - 10% of the battery life was used. I would guess that reported battery life is right accurate.   Typing is easier than on an iPhone, but still not keyboard easy. There's a big problem with how to hold the device and type at the same time. I was a master at Blackberry typing with my thumbs. I can't seem to get it with the iPad. The other problem, the device has a rounded back, so if you place it on a table and try to type, the thing rocks back and forth annoyingly. I don't think I will spend a lot of time typing long emails on this device.    Apps that are built for or converted to the iPad format are simply gorgeous. They are full of detail and easy to read. Old iPhone apps that have not been upgraded are all blocky and not so great (useable but not great). You have the option to click the app back to native size if the jaggies bother you.  Safari works really well on this device. The browser is a real live browser that displays WebPages beautifully. Bookmarks snap up in an instant. Pages load at almost lightning speed, actually faster than on my desktop computer (quad core 3GHz, gigabit wired connection). There is almost no need to have multiple pages open, since load times are so fast and the favorites menu is so easy to access. There is just no comparison to the iPhone's horrible display of WebPages.    Email takes on a whole new look. Embedded pictures display beautifully. There is a pop up ribbon to select email from your inbox. Navigation is just a pleasure. Account switching is a little different from the iPhone, but still very intuitive. Apple seems to have figured out how to make the email experience more intuitive and remove the unnecessary from view.   Video is stunning. Netflix over high speed WiFi (my connection is 22Mbps) delivers full screen, highly detailed, smooth video with good sound. Any video created for the iPhone plays, but they are significantly pixilated or blocky, basically you've blown up a video designed for a three inch screen to three times that size. Those videos are viewable, but I will be reconverting my source video to the larger size.   Some of the free apps I've tried. ABC is simple and stunning for watching video, but lacks a lot of programs. Craigslist adds the ability to view pictures in the preview of a listing, something not available on any other computer - very handy feature. USA Today has done an awful job, the interface is horribly confusing and pretty well useless. Weatherbug is incredible, simple and to the point, but with a ton of forecast information (including webcams for different weatherbug stations). NASA is silly, an enlarged version of their iPhone app. Pandora works perfectly as expected.   The iPod / music side plays like I expected. Nothing really new there. The oddity though, iPod / music is on the home base menu, but video is a separate application. Everyone would expect that Apple got the music player right.   I've had an iPhone 3G for almost two years and have disliked almost every minute of use. I got it for work email and it sort of delivers on that promise. The iPad is what the iPhone should have been all along - fast, simple to use, and a gorgeous screen. I also own a netbook. The iPad is a much better device.   I love this device. Is it a revolution in computing? Only time will tell. For the moment, this is the best video, audio, email, web browsing device I've ever seen.   Go try it at a store. I think you will fall in love.  April 11 Update - Kindle versus iPad - I own them both. The Kindle is the better e-reader by a long long margin for avid readers. e-Ink is easy on the eyes, it looks just like a book. Where ever you can read a book, you can read a Kindle. The Kindle is light weight, about on par with a real book, maybe a bit lighter. And the plastic has a really fine satin feel. After about ten minutes reading on a Kindle, I don't think of the device anymore. The iPad - pages look gorgeous. Winnie the Pooh is absolutely stunning, with the color images, the perfect page layout, sharp beautiful type, fun page turning animation, and a kind of 3D look that mimics a book. But, it weighs a lot more than a book, more like a big old heavy text book. The hand feel - aluminum and glass - not as wonderful as the Kindle. I keep thinking, this is such a cool device that I don't lose myself in the reading.  Buying books with the Kindle is a super snap, under a minute and I've got my book. Buying them with the iPad? Sorry I'll never buy a book through iTunes, just like I've never bought a song at iTunes. Amazon has the review world covered and they know how to sell books.   But, and here's the big but, the majority of the public is going to love the iPad reader software. They will marvel at the color pages and love the book buying experience, just like they love buying music through iTunes. It will be a success. The avid reader will stick with paper or a Kindle, or a Sony reader, or a Nook. There just is no substitute for e-Ink. And, yes my eyes hurt reading the iPad screen; and no you can't read a book easily in the sun (especially not the beach).   And if you think I'm silly saying the device is heavy - there's three pretty savvy tech people that agree, Patrick Norton (a big strong guy) and Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla (an intense WOW gamer, so she has strong hands), and Molly Wood of CNet. Molly has returned her iPad because it is too heavy among other reasons.
like	0	Sturdy and quite heavy for its size, this no-frills Bible is an excellent value, and would make a very good second or third Bible. Well constructed with an imitation leather look on the cover, the font size is not large, but it is in bold print, and very readable and easy on the eyes. What it has:  A presentation page. "Daily Bible Readings," giving a table of three systems for reading the Bible in one year. A seven page history of the Bible, and how the King James Version came to be. First published in 1611, there were several subsequent revisions, and the version we read today is most like the 1769 revision. What it does not have that you would likely find in a better quality Bible: It has no cross-references, making it a poor Bible for study. The words of Jesus are not printed in red. It has no concordance. No maps. No ribbon marker.  Many people use a modern language Bible for study, enabling greater clarity and understanding (and I recommend the New King James Version, or the one I have used for years, the Amplified Bible), but the King James Version is nevertheless glorious in its language, should be read at least once in a lifetime, and is invaluable for comparison of texts, and though I feel it is a sadly short-sighted view, some consider the King James Version as simply great "literature," comparing it to Shakespeare, and read it only for the beauty of its prose. Due to this edition not having cross-references, it does not make a good primary Bible, but will be more than adequate as a secondary translation, and the King James Bible is a version one should definitely own.  Psalm 66:19 King James Version: "But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer." New King James Version: "But certainly God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer." Amplified Bible: "But certainly God has heard me; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer."

When one of the batteries on one of our Roombas finally reached the end of its life cycle, we decided to donate that Roomba to a friend and to get ourselves the new top of the line - the Roomba 560. We got this right when it first came out, but we waited several months before posting a review. It's pretty much impossible to review one of these Roombas after only a few days! It takes weeks if not months to start to see how well they last over time, and what breaks down. Believe me - been there, done that.  So now it's many months later, and I have to say, we are quite pleased with the improvements of this Roomba over the previous generations of Roombas. So first, for those who don't even have ANY Roomba yet (hard to believe!). Roombas are awesome. We have cats, and we work from home so we're home all day. It is AMAZING how much dirt and dust and junk collects in the carpet every single day. Who really has time to vacuum their carpets twice a day any more? With the Roomba, you set the scheduler to do it while you are asleep. You wake up in the morning, the carpets are clean, the air is fresh, and you empty out the dust bin. It is just wonderful.  Even those without pets might be amazed how much lint and such the Roomba will find every morning for you.  I have a noise meter and have done several tests with the noise meter. The Roomba is much quieter than other regular vacuums. It is NOT silent - it can't be! How could it vacuum up dirt and be silent? But it is quieter than the alternatives, and heck, you're sleeping anyway. I can easily sleep through a Roomba running.  Now, on to the improvements of this new Roomba over previous models. First, it has a cool feature where the speed drops when it senses it is approaching a solid object. The old Roomba would just run full tilt into an object - wall, couch etc. - and then turn around. This one slows down so that it hits the object gently. Sure the old Roomba wouldn't dent the walls with its powerful force, but still, it's nice to have it be gentle on furniture and your building.  Next, for better or for worse, the new Roomba is much more aware of when its bin and brushes are getting grungy. I admit I didn't clean my other Roombas as often as I should have. And it led to problems. This new Roomba will actually stop and warn you when it's getting full and when the brushes should be cleaned. If you're a procrastinator like I am, this is a good thing. If you're a clean freak that empties the bin every time, and cleans the brushes every time, then you probably won't even notice this feature.  The anti tangle technology is nice. The previous Roomba would start to eat a cord and just keep going until it was really stuck. This Roomba at least tries to get itself untangled. Still, I don't recommend leaving cords and strings and things lying around. You're just asking for trouble if you do.  The new system uses a "lighthouse" instead of just a wall. With a lighthouse, you mark out a room so the Roomba finishes with that room completely before going on to the next room. They are like section markers. We tend to just use walls, but if you have two large rooms the lighthouse feature might be really helpful for you.  After several months of running we have had NO problems at all with our Roomba. No broken brushes, no falling off pieces, nothing. It is still going strong and we are very pleased with it.  Highly, highly recommended! I am happy to give personal advice and I even have videos of Roombas on my website. I love Roombas, they have saved me countless hours of work, and they make my home a much cleaner and easier-breathing place to be.
like	0	MOMMY'S LITTLE GIRL reads like a novel built on excellent organization & story development.  Unfortunately, it is not fiction.  The victim & protagonist, Caylee Anthony was a real child and Casey Anthony, the antagonist you love to hate was her mother.  Diane Fanning exhibited an uncanny ability to make the reader feel he/she experienced the unfolding of this story.  It's amazing how we can relate to these characters, good & bad.  Certainly it's not over yet but time and the courts will write the final chapter.  The research and organization that went into MOMMY'S LITTLE GIRL shows a mastery of the craft as does the ability to create a sense of the flow of this story that unfolded in starts, jerks, detours and stops.  It would have been easy to just lay out the facts & say, "Here it is!" but in fact, that is left for the reader. Even the well-written afterword leaves room for the reader to draw conclusions.    I strongly recommend this book for anyone trying to delve into the details of this or any true crime case.  It's definitely a step above.

I have used what I learnt from my extensive reading, coupled with academic qualifications, business and psychology experience, to create a consulting company, teaching seminars to corporations in strategic thinking, marketing, goal setting and business development. I also use the principles to help individuals, by guiding them as a Life Coach, teaching people cognitive methods to help goal set and enhance their lives beyond what they could do on their own. As such, I read as many books as I can on a variety of subjects to enhance my knowledge. I can honestly say, that with all that experience, this DVD, is good as an introduction to the concept, BUT it is not as good as a book like Law of Attraction in Action, which I feel covers all bases needed for the LOA to work.  Many people in my experience cannot get the LOA to work, as they have too much OLD subconscious programming blocking the process. You can use the Sedona Method to unblock this old rubbish in the brain, but this DVD, does not cover this area. Also the second key to getting the LOA working, is to take "Inspired Action". This DVD seems to make the case for "thinking will do it all". ACTION, inspired by the dreams, working with a positive mental attitude, is what is needed. This DVD skips this vital part. The aforementioned book covers this area in great detail. I would also highly recommend Your Road Map to Success by John C Maxwell, as a great book to create a life purpose, from which you can use the LOA. There are other great books on the market that can help, but I recommend starting with these.  This DVD is a nice intro into LOA, but you need to do more reading in the areas I have highlighted, if you wish to get the LOA working in your life. Good DVD as far as it goes.

When you have to work to pay for little things others take for granted, e.g. your own education, you have a true sense of what it takes to reach your goals in life.  For this reason, I admire people like Pres. Clinton and Gov. Palin greatly.  Clinton's "My Life" is one of my all-time favorite autobiographies.    As I read through this book, it became clear to me, much like Pres. Clinton, Mrs. Palin is far from a perfect human being and she has not been without fault.  To her credit, she did not try to hide everything in the book.  She admitted to many of the mistakes she made during the campaign and her life in general, and she tried to give a hindsight review of what went wrong and how she should/would have done differently, although I wish she had played less of the blame game in the book overall.  As a political moderate, I can't say I always agree with Gov. Palin's opinions and stances on different issues, but I respect her because she formed them based on her own personal beliefs and experiences and did not blindedly follow "party leaders".  The book also was Gov. Palin's first fair chance to explain some of the controversies that plagued her VP campaign, including the Troopergate, the Couric interview, the pregnancies (both herself and Bristol) and many more stories we never heard.  Whether or not you want to take her words with a grain of salt, it at least is her side of the story that the media never presented us.  All in all, a very good read that took us from her childhood days in Alaska as a tomboy who loved sports and outdoors, to her struggles in early adulthood with her husband and children, and eventually to her glamorous appearance along side Sen. McCain on the campaign trails.  Whether you agree with her politics, I think this book presents much we could learn from her life.  This is my honest review of the book and how much I enjoyed it, not the person or her political positions.  I pre-ordered on Kindle and finished in a little less than two days.

We're not huge tech heads so it pretty much has everything we were looking for. One thing to note is that if you're new to LCD's there's a little adjustment to be made. The refresh rate on  this is 60hz, the higher end ones are 120hz, I believe plasmas are in the 700hz range. You'll notice little things if you're up close, like white caps on waves get a little pixelated. Also your old shows like Sienfeld look really lousy up close. After a few months I don't notice any of this anymore and we're very happy with the TV. We just bought a Sylvania 22" for the bedroom.  Bottom line, for the average TV viewer, great picture and sound, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one. Also, great customer service when I had trouble hooking my computer up through the HDMI port, changed the PC resolution and all was good.

It's short on rhetoric, long on clear-headed, specific ideas on how to fix America's problems. In back are seven key speeches from this long presidential campaign, speeches so beautifully written they read like poetry. Any voter wanting to know more about who Barack Obama is and what he stands for should read this book.  In essence, it's a glimpse into what Obama will do as president, why these actions are smart, and how he'll get the plan done. It's like a presidential crystal ball, letting readers know what they're voting for -- or against.  Change We Can Believe In was put together by Obama for America, with a foreword by the candidate. Net proceeds from book sales will be donated to charity.  The speeches soar. The "race" speech Obama gave in Philadelphia is striking in its honesty: it is from a leader, not a politician. From the New Hampshire Primary Night speech: "And so tomorrow, as we take this campaign south and west, as we learn that the struggles of the textile worker in Spartanburg are not so different than the plight of the dishwasher in Las Vegas; that the hopes of the little girl who goes to a crumbling school in Dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of L.A.; we will remember that there is something happening in America: that we are not as divided as our politics suggests; that we are one people; we are one nation; and together, we will begin the next great chapter in America's story with three words that will ring from coast to coast; from sea to shining sea. Yes. We. Can."  Here's the chapter list:  Foreword by Barack Obama  Part One: The Plan  Introduction: Hope for America  1. Reviving Our Economy: Strengthening the Middle Class * Provide immediate relief with an emergency economic plan * Economic security and opportunity for all American families * Affordable health care for all Americans * Empower families to succeed * Restore trust, return to fiscal responsibility  2.

If you are a parent or younger than 40, I finished the book with a bit of different perspective. I actually am not a fan of Mr. Beck, never seen his show. However he does seem to make some very valid points, especially about the economic troubles facing our nation. So, it's a fast read and if you are open minded, it's interesting and does make common sense.

Plus, the HDMI connections are easy and excellent quality.  I'm 62, and was looking for a box that would let me use the wide selection of Netflix instant download movies and programs.  I'm happy to report that the picture and sound quality of Netflix downloads is very good on the PS3.  Much faster and better than I expected.  Not hi-def, but better than regular TV.  And I have the Blu-Ray to watch movies by mail from Netflix at the highest quality.  Blu-Ray really is an awesome experience if you have a big HDTV and a surround sound system.  I use the Sony CT-500 sound bar and subwoofer that has amazing sound quality and separation.  Sony markets the PS3 as an "entertainment system" and I agree that it serves this function very well for me.  I returned my hi-def cable boxes to Cox and am now saving $65 per month that was being wasted on crummy channels with endless commercials that I never watched.  Now I can get quality programming that I choose myself instantly on demand from Netflix without any commercials.  I can play, pause, and re-play a program as much as I like, just like playing a DVD.  Sony PS3 plus Netflix really is wonderful and cost-effective solution for users like me...  Highly recommended!

By the time the movie came out, I'd nearly forgotten about the book referral, but asked my hubby to take me as it looked like a good vampire romance flick. The scenery of the Pacific Northwest forests, rivers, and coastline was breathtaking and as a native to this area, it was like going out into my own backyard which made the film that more appealing. I was so captivated by the actors portrayal of the characters (the facial expressions and emotions brought out of the characters by Rob, Kristen, Peter, Nikki, and the rest were mesmerizing) and the depth of the back-story left me desiring more! The very next day after viewing the movie in the theater - I raced to the bookstore to grab the first book. I was hooked, read through all four books (plus went to the authors website to read the extra materials she had posted there) in a week. Then, still not satisfied, went back and saw the movie several more times - IN THE THEATER, something I've never felt compelled to do before - because I was so drawn to the characters and the story. This may have been written for the young adult audience but I'm 32 and a parent of four children, and still found the story to be well worth my time.   If you haven't read the stories, I encourage you to do so. Regardless, this film will be a treasured part of your movie collection and one you'll be sure to watch several times before you'll feel satisfied.

I did see a difference but it wasnt a dramatic difference. More like a slight improvement. I hope to use the 3rd vial of gel to improve the results soon. I was hoping for a bright white smile I see other people have but I guess that might only be optained by a visit to the dentist. I have tried the colgate brush on gel and the crest strips. I would say this is the best results of the 3 products. It might be more about my teeth than the product though.

The transfer quality is not what you'd hope for, unfortunately. I realize that this show was likely shot on video rather than film, given the budget and time period, but so were many of my other favorite late 80's/early 90's TV programs and I've seen better results on DVD re-releases than this, the technology exists to clean them up better than this, you could easily forget that you are watching a digital format and not VHS. More importantly, there are also no extras - no commentary, documentaries, production photos, interviews - zip, zilch, nada.   This show was the highlight of my week as a young child, is brilliantly cracked entertainment for me as an adult, and will always hold a special place in my heart, but this DVD release doesn't quite do it justice. The supposed 2005 version mentioned in other reviews has not materialized even now in 2010, but hopefully with Paul Reubens back on stage performing as Pee-Wee, renewed interest in the character will result in the better release it deserves.

like	0	When I first put this album on my wish list, it was something I would have liked to have, but not something that I necessarily needed.  When I first listened to it I said, "Oh this is good." I didnt listen to the whole album at once.  I heard "Undisclosed Desires" and decided I really liked that song, but nothing else really stood out.  Then when I listened further  on in the album, I heard "Exogenesis Part I." I felt like I had been knocked to the floor and my soul had been ripped out; a sign of a really good song for me. I don't know how else to describe this piece of music.  It's not a song, no not at all, it is a piece of music.  The orchestration and the singing are so hauntingly beautiful and full of emotion I just want to put on headphones, crank up the volume and let the music wash over me, painting pictures in my head.  This is what I like to do when I hear a great piece of music, song or album.  After hearing that piece, I decided to read the lyrics.  When I read the 1984 themed-lyrics and listened to the album once again, I realized that "Resistence" is a Rock Opera.  All of the songs align together in a common Totalitarian-Theme: when he meets the woman he is sneaking around with before the thought police can find them, the Exogenesis Cycle wondering how and when will this world end, "the United States of Euroasia" with its a "Queen-like" anthem in it with a Chopin Nocturne with bombs going off in the background. It is incredible, and even more incredible that Matthew Bellamy is playing the classical piano like a maestro, sticks a Saint Saens excerpt in the middle of "I belong to you", and can sing an impressive Falsetto in "Exogenis Part I."  If you listen to the album as a whole, it will tell you a story, and you realize that you can't just listen to one song.  This album is not like any Radiohead that i have ever heard, and in fact that is why I didn't like Muse back around 1999-2000 when they were first coming out. I thought that they were trying to mimic Radiohead, and being a Rabbid Radiohead fan that I am, I didn't want to buy any of their albums.  That is until I heard the song Supermassive Black Hole.  This album doesn't sound like Radiohead, and I think this is Muse's new voice in the music world; it shows they are serious musicians and ready to come into their own.  Screw it if it isn't radio-friendly.  If that's what you care about then don't buy this cd because it is not just a Fluff listen while you are doing something else.  Listen to this album and read the lyrics. I love 1984, and this is about the best rendition or homage I have heard or seen.  Crack open a bottle of wine, take out your headphones, light a candle and lay back and enjoy. I haven't stopped

I did find it difficult to fit at first, but eventually succeeded after 3 tries:  the effort was worth it.  My wife and I began to sleep apart when my snoring became excessive.  I have Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), and like many others have tried and failed to use a CPAP machine.  While the vendor cannot legally claim to be selling a cure for OSA, I have found it to be a cheap and effective substitute for the CPAP.  I not only do not snore when I wear the mouthpiece, but I sleep more soundly as well.  I now wear it even while away on business trips because of the improvement in the quality of my sleep.  For those who have tried CPAP and can't tolerate it, I highly recommend trying this product.

This item arrived quickly, on a Saturday to our surprise, via Fedex. It's a gorgeous (if you like simple/shiny black) piece of AV equipment. At first, we were dismayed by what we thought were little scratches on the top - it was just a piece of protective plastic on it  that is removable; it does have a flawless finish.    I don't usually leave reviews even though I buy on Amazon frequently, and I feel a bit guilty giving this rave reviews as I work for a competitor, but they haven't come out with a similar product yet. We mostly wanted to upgrade the family room/media room for our teens to give them more reason to hang out home with their friends - I must say, that works. They can't wait to show off another blu-ray to friends (who are self-impressed audiophiles for the most part) who are very impressed. The only problem, is, we want to watch it as much as they do... we never used to watch TV this much. I know this sounds like an ad but really, it's that amazing.  The tech stuff: The ease of setup, connection to the TV and the internet is simple and straightforward. One HDMI cable to TV (included w/TV), done. Plug in Ethernet if you don't want to use wireless. It's pure digital output - sound and video. It has a separate Digital audio out for those who were worried about the extra HDMI output. The sound is astonishing. Digital sound, can't beat it. (We're using it with a Philips Soundbar now, but the TV itself has great sound). If you don't have a hi-def TV it might not work as well, but then why buy it anyway? The instruction booklet is good clear English, not written by someone with English as a second-language. The only thing that looks daunting to me is the remote control, but the kids don't seem to have a problem with it.  It performs beautifully in video and sound. It uses 1.4 cables (don't do what we did and buy 1.3 cables, besides the TV comes with cables). It runs on wifi to access the internet, and can download Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, etc., etc., content, and came with coupons for that. The kids like the internet part; we use it much less than they do.  It works flawlessly with our TV. We own the Samsung UN46C7000 46-Inch 3D HDTV and love it; together it's a marriage made in Home Theater Heaven.  It's SUPER fast compared to other blu-Rays we have used. This is the first *3D* blu-ray we have used, and comparing it to regular 2-D blu-rays, it blows them all away. It up-converts beautifully and our 2-D blu-ray videos look like a dream on this.    We have only had it for days so we will write more when we have had more movies under our belts, but: older 3d movies look amazing, regular 2-D (most blu-rays are still) and downloads. All we can say so far is WOW. If you are interested in upgrading to a new 3D TV in the near future, this is a no-brainer to buy,   Movies we suggest to knock your socks off:  National Geographic 3D movies, Polar Express, Bugs!,the IMAX movies, and the new Micheal Jackson movie. Older teens liked the Bloody Valentine movie. The kids - even my son - reverted to movies like Snow White (the new blu-ray) to my surprise, just because it was so "flipping awesome" to watch on this player.  WARNING: If you have a hard time pulling yourself away from the TV set (we never used to like we do now) - don't buy this. You won't want to leave the room.  If you're looking for a top-notch, latest technology Blu-ray player with extras that's going to work quickly, this is a good buy. I've blathered on enough; check it out.

I have a regular family plan with AT&T and of course the customer service will not tell you that you can use a gophone as a replacement.  If you aren't eligible for an upgrade they will tell you that you have to buy one at full price, usually $200 & up.  Gophones work just fine, just don't use the sim card that comes with it, put in the one from your old phone.  It actually has directions inside the package that tells you how to use the gophone with your regular plan, and they credit the $50 airtime as like an extra 150 minutes to your plan.  As far as the phone, I couldn't be happier.  The slide feature is great with the qwerty keyboard and the battery life has been great.  We have three LG phones in our plan and they all use the same chargers, which is very convenient.
like	0	I bought this phone on the day it came out and I have to say that I am not disappointed at all.  If you like a pull-out/physical keyboard, then this phone is not for you.  But if you like the touchscreen, this is an amazing phone.  I find the new sure-press screen very comfortable to type on, and the phone's capabilities are terrific.  I've already synced my iTunes music to the phone and no longer carry around an iPod. The network speed when using the Internet is great, but of course that's because Verizon has a solid network. 
like	0	This micro SDHC card is the best in the US market. Samsung has developed a 32GB one but it is only available in Asia at the time of this writing. With that said, this is a good card. I bought it for my Blackberry Curve 8300. If you are going to use it for a Blackberry, make sure that you have the Blackberry OS 4.5 or later as it will not read the whole 16GB if you do not.  Even though this is a Class 2 card (the 16GB Class 4's, like the 32GB cards, are only available in Asia right now), it reads and writes fairly quickly. The card is fast enough to record and play videos on my Curve, and saving a couple minute video after shooting it literally takes seconds to write.  I have two minor gripes about this card, and they aren't that bad. One is the price. You can get an 8GB card for less than half of the price of this one. However, it is still "new" so that's the penalty for being an early adopter.  The other gripe I have is that with the Samsung reader (see the bundle Amazon sells with this card) will NOT format this card in anything other than FAT32. Now the Curve can't understand NTFS, so for me it's not a big deal, but for someone who may want to use this as take away storage, just be aware of that.  Other than that, I think this card is great. Also please note this card DOES come with an SD adapter. Don't let the Bulk Packaging fool you. If you have an SD card reader, you will not have to go out and buy a separate card reader for this. Save yourself the 5 bucks if you can. I hope this review was helpful.

Took me three days to read the book because it was so formulaic, so boring, so unreal, and just not funny.  Unbelievable story-line.  I don't like Vinnie.  I don't understand where Blutto came from, too many unanswered questions.  I think Stephanie needs to get some counseling, she has real issues.  I found two spelling errors in the book which hasn't happened before.  Sorry, Janet, this one just isn't sizzling at all.

After several hours of play, I think it's fair to say that "Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3" continues this trend.  The gameplay is fairly realistic, given that P3 is a Japanese RPG. In battle, they may stumble when attacking and leave themselves vulnerable to the enemies' attacks. If you try to push them too hard, they will get tired, which will affect their performance. Ignore their fatigue, and they will get sick, which further hampers them. This principle applies to the main character, whom the player directly controls. Try to do everything, and you won't be able to do anything particularly well.  Since part of the game involves the character's day-to-day life as a high school student, one cannot expect major plot turns every day. However, the choices the player makes in school do have an effect on the player's options as a Persona user. The more connections the player forges with other students, the more power he will bring to bear as a Persona user, so expect consequences if you decide to play as a loner.  Some players may find some of the imagery in this game disturbing, or even offensive. The characters summon their Personae by using a gun-like device called an Evoker. Unlike another reviewer, I do not think that they are mimicking suicide. Instead, given that in-game dialogue suggests that one can summon a Persona without an Evoker, I think that the Evoker is used to break down a character's inner barriers so that his Persona can manifest. While I understand why the summoning animations may be offensive to some, I do think that Atlus did it this way for a legitimate reason. However, parents thinking of getting this game for their teenage children should be aware that this game contains imagery that may be inappropriate.  As for the title of this review, I think this might be a thinking man's RPG because of the themes I've encountered thus far. I haven't completed the game yet, so I can't say I've seen everything it has to offer. However, given the introductory movie that plays when you load the game, I think that Persona 3 will give an attentive player a few things to think about. For example, the player is asked to sign a contract at the beginning of the game. The terms seem simple enough, but when is responsibility ever simple?  As for technical details; the graphics are somewhat minimalist, but very stylish. I think that the character and Persona portraits were well done, but I don't think that Kazuma Kaneko (who handled character design for the other SMT games on the PS2) was involved. Shoji Meguro, however, handled the soundtrack. I suspect that some of the hip-hop influenced tracks may begin to grate on me after further play, but I am a long-haired metalhead. Your mileage may vary. You may also dislike the voice acting, but the Config menu includes an option to turn off voiced dialogue for players who just want text.  I heartily recommend SMT: Persona 3, and think it's worth the fifty bucks I paid for it. Buy it instead of renting it, and you'll get a nice little art book and soundtrack disc in the package.
like	0	I was really hesitant to buy this phone due to the conflicting reviews I read from various sources.  I wanted to replace my Samsung Eternity, which I really loved, but as time went on I found that not having voice dial was a real annoyance, making my blue tooth headset virtually useless.  Then again, I didn't like the idea of giving up a speedier interface. I made my decision. After getting the Mythic, I'm happy to announce that all my reservations were put to rest.  This phone is everything the Eternity was, except that everything I felt that needed improvement was realized in the Mythic. No regrets here! My major complaint is that Samsung's New PC Studio no longer provides support for backing up your address book, or your calendar events. I'm sure this has more than a little to do with at&t's desire to charge you $3.00 per month to do this for you (address book only).  You may want to think twice about filling up the 2000 entry capable contact list on the Mythic.  If fact, the biggest problem with this phone is that just about every application it offers will suck you dry with a monthly fee, as opposed to a one-time purchase for it. Even Mobile Email with cost you $5.00 per month now. I guess we're just not paying enough for cell phone service these days.  If you want your Outlook Express email on your phone, get a Gmail account with Google, set up their IMAP server, and you can link up with your email and make it look like you're sending and receiving from your Outlook account. Once you're all set up, simply import your contacts from Outlook Express to Gmail, then bookmark Google's link to their Gmail into your phone's browser, or download their Gmail app to your phone for free. All your contacts from Outlook will be available either way. UPDATE: After reading a post by E. McGlynn, I can confirm that "New PC Studio version 1.2.1 IH1" will allow you to back up your contacts and calendar events. Why this version isn't packaged with the Mythic is beyond me, except for maybe the reasons stated above. Thank you, E. McGlynn, so much for your valuable post. Here are some of my impressions of the Mythic:  The Interface - Yes, the interface isn't as snappy as it is on the Eternity, but you will forget about this when you see the gorgeous 3.3", 360x640 pixel screen.  I'm guessing this has something to do with the sluggishness, due to the increased amount of picture data that has to be switched around to form a new screen, or change from landscape to portrait mode. If this is so, it's a worthwhile trade-off. The print on web pages is so sharp; I don't need to zoom in to read the smallest. If you're switching from a phone like the Eternity to the Mythic, you just need to learn to relax and slow down a bit when touching your way around the screen.  The Touch Screen - There is definitely a learning curve with the touch screen.  At first I thought there were times it was unresponsive, and sometimes it still does seem to be, but after a little experience with the phone, these "unresponsive times" are few and far between. The screen is not only sensitive to touch, but also to how long you touch it for. This is necessary so you're not always moving widgets all over the place every time you swipe the screen. When using the browsers (there are two), a prolonged touch will give you more options on the screen. If you're somewhere in between with your touch, I feel that this can sometimes confuse the software as to what your intent is, so it does nothing. So you need to practice.  Whether you're on the home screens, or the menu screens, there are 3 horizontal dashes, side by side, at the top of the screen. When on home screen 1 (or menu screen 1), the first dash highlights. Screen 2, the second dash highlights, etc.. When swiping your finger across the screen to change it, it's very easy to activate the widgets, causing great frustration. Swipe too hard, you activate the widgets, too soft, the screen doesn't move. Solution: swipe your finger or thumb across those dashes at the top of the screen. This works so well, it leads me to believe that this was Samsung's intent.  It only takes the slightest pressure to move the screens, first time, every time!  The Virtual Keyboard - I love this keyboard. As much as I liked the Eternity's, this one is better.  The keys are offset like a computer keyboard, as opposed to block style, and there are spaces between the keys. The keyboard is plenty roomy enough, and I make much fewer mistakes on it than my previous phone.  I can move right along on it with no lag.  When changing the keyboard from portrait mode to landscape mode, there is more lag time than I'm used to on the Eternity, but guess what....I compared it to my nephew's iPhone, and the lag time is the same.  Texting is a breeze with this phone. If you're in a hurry and need to type super fast, keep the T9 on.  It will work like an auto-correct feature.  The Camera and Video - Sorry to say, the Eternity, at 3 mpix, no auto-focus and no flash, takes better pictures under more conditions than the 3.2 mpix Mythic WITH auto-focus and a flash. In fact, I'm finding that the auto-focus is just a time consuming farce. I've been taking identical pictures using the auto-focus, and then just taking the picture without waiting, and there is no difference. If I crop a picture, I find that sometimes the result is clearer WITHOUT the auto-focus. Nice try, Samsung.  There were times when my Eternity, under best conditions, took pictures that rivaled those taken with my camera. The pictures on the Mythic can at times be very good, but mostly they are a little fuzzy.  Subjects at the edges of the pictures will suffer a little with barrel distortion, but I've found this true with any camera-phone I've owned. Any movement by your subject will show up as a blur in the photo. Under very dark lighting conditions, the Mythic wins over the Eternity, due to its flash, but the pictures will be grainy and the colors will be distorted and washed out. Having said all this, many people will find the pictures to be very good, and in all fairness, they are better than on some popular smart phones I've seen that have 5 mpix.  The video recorder on the phone is just adequate. Along with two resolution choices, there are three viewing modes: Small (picture box), Medium (fills screen top to bottom), and Distorted (fills screen left to right). This last mode is horribly pixilated with choppy motion. You choose the mode with the little box in the upper left with the circle in the middle and the arrows radiating out towards the four corners. Oddly enough, the playback of the videos defaults to the worst viewing mode. UPDATE: The default viewing mode for video playback can be changed during the playback of a video. Simply touch the edit icon (the lined page on top of the horizontal pencil)at the bottom-left of the screen, and you'll see the "Display Mode" button. Touch this and choose your new default viewing mode.  The Internet - There are two browsers on this phone. There's the Mobile Web, which at&t seems to promote with its dedicated widget, and then there's simply "Browser" over in applications.  Mobile Web is powered by Opera Mini.  You must choose your viewing mode, landscape or portrait, mobile or HTML. You do this in "settings". This browser does a very nice job rendering web pages.  It's also the more finicky one when it comes to touch. At first I was touching links three or four times to activate them. You really need to get the hang of it.  Once you do, you'll find it's very responsive with the quickest and lightest of touches.  The other browser is the old, familiar one I had on the Eternity. It automatically changes from landscape to portrait, but chooses how the page will load best. This is the browser that the Facebook widget uses.  Sometimes the Facebook page loads extra tiny for some unexplained reason. When this happens, the screen can respond strangely when you try to navigate.  It will seem to freeze, but then "catch up" and start moving on it own. Luckily, this happens only sporadically. This browser also allows you open multiple web pages at one time, for tabbed browsing. Also, any links you bookmark with this browser are stored in the "Favorites" widget on the widget tool bar.  Both browsers have their advantages and do a good job. One may render the same page better than the other.  The "Browser" may be better for quickly checking things like weather, sports, etc.  The Mobile Web is probably better for surfing content rich websites. It's strictly a personal preference. They both have their own personalities, and I use both equally.   Voice Commands - This is a great feature for some people. I am a carrier for the U.S.P.S.   At certain times during the year, my phone is under 3 or 4 layers of clothes. Two layers cover my head.  I don't have time to stop and make phones calls, but if I did, reaching for my phone under those layers with a gloved hand is an invitation to send the phone tumbling to the asphalt.  With voice commands, problem solved!  Even with my bluetooth headset under my headwear, people have no trouble hearing me and I have no problem hearing them. At the touch of the button on my bluetooth, I can check time, date, go to voicemail, call the Post Office with a problem, check the phone's battery, signal strength, or whether I really did feel my phone vibrate with a new message, and more, all while leaving my phone safely in its holster under all my clothes. This is invaluable for me, though probably not for everyone.  The Battery - The battery life is excellent for a phone with such power hungry features.  My phone is turned on at 5:30am, and shuts off at 10:30pm. If I use the phone only when needed, there will be at least 4 out of 5 bars at the end of the day, sometimes 5. If I'm out and about on a day off, constantly texting, checking Facebook, surfing the web and playing with features that keep the phone backlit constantly, I MAY drain the battery by the end of the day. Most of the time there are one or two bars left.  As I've found with most digital volume indicators, the last two thirds of the increments disappear as fast as the first third. They simply aren't linear. So if you use 2 out of 5 increments the first day, don't think your phone will last another day and a half of the same usage. It may not make it till the end of the second day.  This phone has been great for me thus far.  I'm finding that most of the things a smart phone can do, are things I'm never going to need on a regular basis anyways.  They aren't things that can justify an extra $15 per month out of my pocket.  This phone comes close to a smart phone.  Very close.

I chose this model over the very popular oil-free pancake compressors mainly for it's compact size and low noise level....and it did not dissappoint me.  I would say this unit is half as loud as those typical oil-fee models by P*rter C*ble.  I can easly run it indoors while remodeling a bedroom, and hardly hear in the room next door. The unit is compact, but much heavier duty than similar Cr*ftman compressors I saw at Sears.  It recycles quickly and fills the tank in less than 20 seconds.  It came with a good owner's manual and a bottle of oil.  I did have a problem where the plastic oil filler cap was cracked, but Makita quickly sent me a replacement part under warantee.  I would recommend this unit to anyone looking for an occasional use compressor and does not want something large or loud.
like	0	I use the nono on my upper lip and chin, even though the user manual says not to. In order to get close to upper lip hair without burning my actual lip, I hold a facecloth over my lip with my other hand.  I have had laser hair removal on this area in the past but it is expensive, and it only worked ok, not great. The nono actually works better than laser hair removal did for me. It is easy and fast to use, and less expensive than laser hair removal. I use it about every 3-4 days.  It works good, not great. Works better on my lip than my chin. I have been using it for about 4 weeks and I am seeing a decrease in the amount of hair. I have very sensitive skin so between the nono and the 'buffing' afterward, my skin does feel a little chapped, but not to bad, I put neosporin on the area or that sally hansen 'zero irritation' bikini area cream and that helps too. sometimes I get little papercut like marks if I go over any one area to many times, but they are not so visible. Sometimes it takes a little while for the little bits of hairs to work themselves all the way out from underneath the skin, you can kind of see and feel them in there before the come out, and it might take a little bit of coaxing with squeezing your the skin between your fingers or a tweezer just to guide out the bit of hair. Overall, I am pleased. It is not a miracle cure, but it does work well for me, it's fast, easy and cheaper and works better than using laser hair removal over and over. Plus, you can do it right from home.  I would recommend this product!- Dottie from Massachusetts

The packaging lacked a lot of styrofoam protection and the box was a bit tattered from the shipping, but overall it's a good deal, because of the free shipping for this 50lb. plus item. My refrigerator did not arrive with any obvious damage or dents. And the stainless steel is sweet.

He is one of the most  startlingly original characters in modern fiction, and his efforts at  hitting the job market after his mother smashes their car will leave you in  stitches. A word on the history of the novel is worth mentioning here.   The author, John Kennedy Toole, committed suicide in 1969, and his mother  found the hand-written manuscript in her son's papers.  She brought them to  a publisher, who dreaded having to read even a portion of the work and to  notify Toole's mother that it stunk.  Instead, he was blown away by Toole's  draft, and the rest is history.  The novel earned him a posthumous Pulitzer  Prize, and it is universally hailed by critics. Trying to summarize the  plot is impossible - the book cannot really be categorized.  Ignatius is an  over-educated  oaf who stays home filling his writing tablets full of his  offbeat musings on ancient history, which he plans to organize and publish  some day but which presently reside all over his bedroom floor. Rome wasn't  built in a day he reminds himself.  He cites in footnotes, as authority for  some of his offbeat opinions, papers he had previously written and  hand-delivered to the local university library for inclusion into their  archives.  He watches dreadful tv shows and movies, howling at the screen  with a mixture of delight and loathing at the teenybopper drivel, and in  the privacy of his room his self-gratification is performed while imagining  visions of the old family dog. And wait til you see him out in public,  getting a series of odd jobs, including a filing clerk at Levy Pants (with  very innovative filing techniques to avoid crowded file space) as well as a  costumed hot dog vendor wandering around the French Quarter in a pirate  costume. All the while he begins work on his latest opus, The Journal of  the Working Boy. There is a latent sadness to the plot, for while you are  laughing out loud at Ignatius, his bowling-addicted mother, and the motley  crew of skillfully drawn supporting characters, you sense that he will  never really belong anywhere, and that he realizes his outcast status with  his innate intelligence. Perhaps the author felt the same way in 1969,  leading to his own suicide.   However, at least Toole did leave us A  Confederacy of Dunces, a novel which reveals more with each rereading.   Keep it on your shelf, and every now and then pick up the book to any page  and marvel at the absurdity of Ignatius's grandiose ramblings, read exerpts  of his bizarre historical writings, and revisit his comic efforts to  organize a worker's revolt at Levy Pants. The list goes on and on. There is  no work of litereature like it I know, and my only regret in reading Toole  is the sorrow felt in knowing the tremendous body of work that was lost  when he ended his life.

I realized that, after shelling out some real money for those dinky 3-packs at Sports Authority or Modell's, I stumbled across the 12-pack offered on Amazon and, well...I got it!   This isn't a real big deal, but I really like the way the individual grips are packaged. They are more folded than rolled, which prevents the overgrip from rolling up by itself after you've unraveled it. Again, NOT a big deal, but an added bonus IMO.   The texture of this grip is just tacky enough where it doesn't interfere with quick grip changes. It is, however, sticky enough to adequately stay in your hand without you having to worry about a slippery handle.   I don't remember if other colors are offered, but to me, WHITE is pretty classic on a tennis racket. Maybe it's because Federer uses it, and I love the guy, but regardless, buy this package of grips and be content!

The old USB cables did have a serious problem with jiggling loose and I could never use them on my laptop if there was any chance the laptop might move even a little for fear of disturbing the cable. I do not have that problem anymore with this passport.   The USB cable is a micro USB cable that is the same as on my BlackBerry 8900. Everyone crying about the "proprietary" cable... get a grip. It's not and it fits way more securely than the cable type it replaced.   I'm favorable to the software too. I want something hardware based that will password protect my drive because I use WD Passports exclusively as portable backup drives that are secondary backups in case of disaster. I own a bunch of them. This also means that I don't need to interact with the drive all that often so perhaps if I had to use this drive a dozen times a day and had to deal with the auto-mounting partition, it might get annoying, but it hardly seems like a big deal to me. I don't need the backup software on it so I can't comment on if that's any good at all but it's not getting in the way either. I use Apple's Time Machine programs to backup directly to this disk at least once a week and it has no conflicts with the permanent backup software on the drive.   As for the drive itself, all I can say is that it's so far so good. I've only had mine a few weeks. It's worked fine, it's fast, it's quiet, and it doesn't accidentally disconnect all the time like some of my older WD Passports. I normally wouldn't write a review so soon as the real test is if the drive is healthy after a few months of real use, but I just couldn't believe all the  bellyaching going on here. Until further notice, I wish all of my WD Passports were like this version.

His writing style is captivating at a minimum.  Even though we know how it turns out, I couldn't put the book down.  The reader learns what is going on inside the King organization prior to the killing and what is going on with the assassin, James Earl Ray.  The author is from Memphis and his love and concern for the city shows in the way he invovles Memphis in the unfolding drama.  The tension around the actual shooting, and the unbelievably thorough search for Ray were the best parts of the book for me.  By the time the good guys have Ray under arrest, I felt like I had grown to actually know him.  I would have liked to see the author wrtie a bit more about the trial and Ray's time in prison, but I guess the book had to have boundaries.  A great, and fun read.  Unqualified five star recommendation

I never had any sensitivity to any sort of strip, so, I was confident that Crest's newest 3D whitening strips would be fine for me.  And they were!    After just 3 days of using the strips, I noticed a dramatic difference in the color of my coffee-stained teeth!  I noticed the change in color both in person, as well as in photographs of myself.  After 10 days, my teeth were glowing white - not so white that you'd think they were fake, just a nice, healthy white smile!   I have nothing but great things to say about Crest's 3D Whitestrips!  The "advanced seal" is amazing - no more goopy strips that feel like they are slipping everywhere in your mouth!  These strips are going to be my go-to strips every six months now!  These are fantastic!

We tested the Wii before its launch day (I'm a game reviewer), and we had our own unit in our home the morning of launch day. Here are our findings.  The Wii is designed around a menu of "channels". There is of course the game-playing channel, where the Wii will play any Wii or GameCube game. Simply load the disc in and go. There is a Mii channel where you set up a profile and avatar to connect to all your game playing. The Photos channel lets you look at photos on your TV. Other channels for news, weather, and online shopping require an interent connection; the news and weather were not actually working at launch time.  The system does NOT have a regular network cable port, which both the PS3 and XBox 360 have. Instead, it works with built in wireless or with a USB network adapter. I am a firm proponent of wireless - less clutter! So I am thrilled that they offer wireless automatically. With the PS3, you have to pay extra for the 60 gig unit to get this built in. The XBox 360 requires extra hardware as well.  It's hard to generalize gameplay on any console - it really depends on what games you buy. That being said, the comes-with-it software of Sports is really quite fun and is about as basic as you can get. You swing at baseballs, lob tennis balls, bowl, box and play golf. A "fitness" mode puts you through a variety of tasks and then calculates your fitness age, sort of like how Brain Age keeps track of your mental age. If you did both every day, you could aim to be as fit mentally and physically as possible!   In a world where video games = couch potato, it really is quite amazing to have a game where it natively expects you to move and be active. You don't lounge back and gain pounds here while playing games. Boxing can be quite strenuous, jabbing, blocking and weaving in real life. Tennis involves quick reflexes and strong arm movements. Bowling might be the most relaxed of the sports, but even there you are standing, moving, swinging. You get your heart going at least a little, and get some exercise. My boyfriend had a sore arm after playing for a number of hours, in a good way, as he would from exercising.  The 480p resolution is certainly not high def 1080p like the other two systems. It's something you accept when you're paying such a low price for the console. But really, it's not that big a deal. I still play the old Zeldas and love them for their gameplay, even though you can't see the pores in Link's face. If they are going for the cartooney characters and environments, 480p is DVD quality and is quite good. If you really, really crave high definition super realism in your games, then the Wii might not be the best choice for you. However, if you're fine with playing games with a more impressionist / cartooney look to them, the 480p can show that quite nicely. For example, there aren't fans in the stands for baseball - there are colored blocks.  Nintendo has always been known as a "Kid's Console" - but I really do think with the Wii that they have become a "Family Console". It's not just kids who will enjoy this. Seniors can have fun bowling without knowing anything "Tricky" about how to use a video game unit. It's very intuitive. Moms can easily play with their kids, each with their own Wii profile. Adults having parties can have fun passing the controllers around. Family groups can share slideshows on the big screen while hanging out and drinking wine. Every person who has come over - from 8 to adult - has instantly understood and enjoyed the Wii, without much explanation at all.  With the price tag being so low, a gaming household that "needs" a higher end system can easily save up their money to get that XBox 360 or PS3 - and still be able to justify to get a Wii for the fun, casual gaming stuff to share with their non-gaming friends.  Well recommended! Since I own all three systems, and am playing all three wirelessly, feel free to contact me if you have any further questions.  ================  Update: One year later, and the Wii is still going strong! It's really funny how many people said the Wii would bomb because it wasn't as good as the PS3 or 360 - and here we are a year later and the Wii is still the system that people are really wanting to get. Hospitals are getting Wiis for their patients to play with. Senior centers are getting Wiis for their residents to play games together with. I was just on a cruise ship and they had Wii tournaments going on every day! This is a fantastically fun system that we really enjoy playing with and that literally the whole family can have fun with. There are great games for kids, great games for teenagers, great games for adults. I am really very pleased with how the Wii has held up and the game set available for it.  Update 2: 2 years later! Our Wii is still adored in our household, used just as much as the PS3 and XBox 360. I was just at a bar and they had two Wiis set up for people to play with, and everybody loved them. This really is an "every person's gaming system".  I'm running out of space here, but my nintendo.bellaonline.com site has full articles on exactly what you get in this box, and what else you should buy so you have a full system to play with.

Simply put, the cover is goofy, and does not do this masterpiece any justice.  I am so grateful that I  ignored my initial instinct, as I don't remember ever reading a funnier  book in the English language than the late John Kennedy Toole's life  achievement, nor is there a more memorable character in American literature  than I. J. Reilly.  The work deserves a 6 star rating!  &quot;A Confederacy  of Dunces&quot; is more than just incredibly funny, however.  It is  unusually poignant, gut-wrenchingly sad, and an admirable observation piece  on a rather decadent and seemingly lost segment of our society sitting at  the mouth of the Mississippi River.  I have visited New Orleans three times  since 1994 for varied reasons, and the city apparently has not changed in  the least since Mr. Toole's late 1960s rendition.  His characters continue  to stroll and struggle along Bourbon Street and Canal Street, and their  troubled spirits infuse every alley and cave of the French Quarter.  Just  like the district surrounding St. Peter's Square in the city of jazz,  Ignatius J. Reilly is out of step with the rest of America.  In spite of  his repulsive and grossly comical physical presence, he believes in  aesthetics and real meaning, in what he perceives to be the truth.  For  this reason, he is a true literary hero, like Don Quixote, Cyrano de  Bergerac and the Good Soldier Schweik before him.     One final note:  before you buy this book, think about cancelling all your appointments and  engagements for the two or three days that follow.  They, along with eating  and sleeping, undoubtedly will be totally neglected until you finish this  400 page tour de farce.

I notice this to be something a lot of artists are doing these days, and it probably is just a ploy to cash in, but I personally enjoy live CDs, and especially DVDs, so you can relive the experience or merely feed your curiosity if you missed one of your favorite groups in concert. I haven't seen Evanescence in person yet but after watching the DVD portion of 'Anywhere But Home', which was taped at a sold-out venue in Paris, I definitely think it would be worth it to try sometime. Amy Lee looks innocent yet deadly, her haunting vocals are in healthy form and the band sounds better than ever whilst they perform their greatest hits...which is basically everything since their melodies are all so unforgettable....   Many people claim Amy doesn't sing as well in concert as she does on her studio recordings and though they may be right, take into consideration the fact that she obviously gets really into the songs and because she jumps around so much, which equals exhaustion and breathlessness, I felt she did a pretty damn good job at controlling the words and pacing. You'll notice during the songs she sings while sitting at the piano, like on the wonderful Korn cover of "Thoughtless", the stunningly emotional "Breathe No More", and of course the infamous "My Immortal" she sounds quite better. Also, during a live event if you mess up there's no turning back so be grateful she doesn't lip synch like countless other acts around. And I'm so sick of people dissing this group simply because they had a lucky break and hit it big thanks to the 'Daredevil' soundtrack. I'm not saying Evanescence is better than similar groups who get far less recognition (or at least in the states) like Lacuna Coil, 'cause they're not, but they've also been around a while now so their fame didn't exactly happen over night.  Bottom line is they've got undeniable talent and they are, in my opinion, a blessing to mainstream music which is mostly full of crap. But back to the CD/DVD combo...   Closing the set is the new, or rather recycled track "Missing" (originally found on their hard-to-find 'Origins' CD) and it's a beautiful orchestral ballad, however it's the DVD that's truly spectacular! Aside from the concert it also features a lot of bonus material, and it isn't just filler either. The behind the scenes is great because you get to see a little of how they are in real life and it's not at all boring. It also includes all their videos to date, which are some of the most inventive I've seen in a long time ("Everybody's Fool" is without a doubt my favorite). And for the most part the concepts actually relate to the lyrics.  I predict Evanescence will be around for many years to come and I can't wait to hear their new album set for release sometime next year.

On the plus side:  *Unit is small (just a bit bigger than a deck of cards) *it is so simple to use *take it anywhere and a ton of fun *does not need ink  *can run on batteries *bluetooth your pictures to it from you cell phone *There is nothing out there like it  Wish it had: *Larger size (I hope they are working on one already) *longer battery life (only 15 prints per charge)  I took mine on the plane last week and then to dinner, it received so much attention, what a blast. So many people were asking "what is that" and "can you take a picture of me".  I hope they come out with one that prints larger sizes. The pictures are very good quality (better than polaroid instant, but not HD quality) but then again the fun factor is what this is made for, and if you like a picture you can print as many as you want.   I give it a thumbs up, can't wait till the next model (Come on Polaroid!)  For a first run, I say home run, they could tweek it a bit and it would be perfect.

It is a lot like the original, except in space. You mine for substances, and upgrade your spaceship, instead of improving your mount. Instead of magic, you have lasers and shields. Although, there are some psychic powers.   All-in-all the new board with the multiple angles is more challenging, and the 'jump-gate' hacking can get tense because of the time limits. I think this is a good upgrade to a great game, and it will probably chew up a similar amount of my free time as the original.

It does clean up most spots with a varying degree of repeated applications, but there are those that it just doesn't have much of an effect on.  (My cats have a tendency to cough up some hairballs that come with food stains--salmon is especially tenacious.  One of them somehow manages to get the hairball-prevention goop from her paw onto the carpet in small amounts.  Surprisingly, the cleaner does quite well in getting those up when they do not respond to the Oxy Deep spray method.) I do like that I can clean smaller high traffic areas, such as the transition areas from the carpet to the tiled rooms (kitchen, bathroom) to help keep them fresh.  I have purchased a different cleaning solution, supposedly of a higher cleaning ability, so perhaps that will remedy those spots that are less responsive to the sample that came with the unit.  It's easy to use and clean and fairly portable.

Those tapes documented the extreme torture of ghost detainees, individuals captured and whisked away to secret prisons, people who simply disappeared. Waterboarding, while documented on the tapes, was not the worst thing that happened to the ghost detainees. Ulrich, the lead operative, crafts a plausible story to spin to the media, which allows everyone else to sigh in relief.   Two years later, someone surfaces, contacts one of the operatives, and tells him that he is in possession of the ninety-two videotapes. He will release them to the world's media in five days if he is not paid $100 million in small, uncut diamonds.  In a Manila jail, Ben Treven is awaiting his fate for the killing of an Australian sailor. Ben was a member of an elite squad of men who "fixed" problems. He was hand picked for the squad because of his skills in stealth, observation and tactics, and use of deadly force. Waiting out his days, he is visited by his old commander, Colonel "Hort" Horton, who has a proposition; find and detain the person that is blackmailing the United States government. There are not many clues, however Hort believes that a dead man has the tapes, a person who died in an explosion in Pakistan in 2007.  Treven wants out of the jail, but he also wants a measure of revenge from Hort, who tried to kill him, his brother, and a female lawyer when an advanced encryption software program was being readied for market. Treven accepts the offer.  It isn't long until Ben discovers that he isn't the only person looking for the tapes or the blackmailer; the FBI and CIA are on the case as well. The CIA is willing to kill in order to recover the tapes. Ben's unique skills as a military assassin will be tested if he is to be the first to the finish line.   Barry Eisler has published another excellent novel that focuses on a character, Ben Treven, whom he introduced in his 2009 novel, Fault Line. Inside Out propels Ben to the forefront; you learn more about him, his training, his background, and the skills that make him so effective and deadly. Should you be unfamiliar with Fault Line, do not worry, Eisler provides a few references, but they are not necessary to the story line of Inside Out. What you will become familiar with in this novel are some of the darkest secrets of government. While Eisler has crafted an excellent thriller, it isn't until you reach the Sources and Bibliography that you realize that he has scripted a fictional account of real events.  That is not all, however. Eisler works some other ideas into the novel, ones that will make you reconsider what you think you hear, what you think you know. For a work of fiction, it is startling in its depth of research, as presented by the bibliography. Further, Eisler worked another of his characters, John Rain, into Inside Out, which bodes well for regular readers of his novels. The future is bright for Eisler's fans and those that like thrilling action, well defined characterization, believable dialog, and thought provoking story lines.

So my husband heavily researched all current powered toothbrush models and brands and the end result was our purchasing the Sonicare Essence 5300.   This toothbrush is absolutely AMAZING! It deeply cleans your teeth & stimulates your gums so very gently and leaves your mouth feeling like it was just professionally cleaned everytime!! It is such a pleasure to use, that my husband and I have both found that we brush twice as long! The 2 minute timer will shut off the toothbrush, but we will turn it back on and end up brushing until it goes off again.   We opted to get a model without the Quad timer, but I can see how it would be useful, as it would notify you when to go to a new section of your mouth! It is also fairly quiet when operating compared to the Oral-B model we were using.   The overall design of the toothbrush, base and brushhead holder is simple, minimal and clean and does not clutter up your counter too much. The brushhead holder holds 2 replacement heads and works perfectly for couples. Sonicare also color codes their replacement heads, so that when you buy a pack, one will have a grey ring and one a blue ring, so they can be used by 2 different people. Very convenient and helpful!  This toothbrush will leave your mouth very happy and healthy and is definitely worth the money!

I assumed it was more of a movie like Event Horizon, where a lonely person stumbles on some mind-blasting truth. Fortunately, I was wrong.   Actually, that's an accurate description of the film - it's jut that the mind-blasting truth is eminently relatable and human. Moon's a lot more complicated than it looks.   Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the sole inhabitant of a moon base dedicated to mining Helium-3 for Lunar Industries.  His companion is GERTY (Kevin Spacey), a ceiling-hung robot that expresses itself through emoticons. For three years, Sam has overseen the various mining robots, worked on his wooden models, talked to his plants, and longed to be reunited with his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) and daughter Eve (Rosie Shaw). With his time up, he's ready to go home. The catch is that Sam perceives everything through a filtered lens - even his transmissions to Earth are delayed.  Sam isn't just alone for three months; he's alone without any synchronous human contact.    Red herrings abound. It's easy to focus on the HAL-like robot GERTY, a major character and foil for Sam. How can you trust something that sounds so benign as Kevin Spacey? Ironically, GERTY is one of the most human characters on the base.   Moon's twist isn't in the revelation of The Truth, but in its implications.  Moon questions who Sam is, what he represents, and what makes him - and us - human.  We are, the director seems to say, defined by our memories, and that's enough to fuel us in our daily grind.  Sam is every worker who has been at it for years, always waiting for the next big break, the next reorganization, the next lotto ticket that will get him out of the crappy dead end job. It's a lot like Memento, high praise for a film that cost just $5 million to produce.  The fun is in watching Sam deal with the truth of his situation and how he rises above it (or succumbs to it). Moon is littered with clues, making it worth another view. This is a tightly crafted, smart film that takes a single science fiction element and explores it thoroughly.

It's smaller in size than the DVD player it is replacing but noticeably heavier. It starts up quickly and loads Blu-ray discs quickly too. The buttons on the front of the player are touch sensitive and don't give the user any tactile feedback so sometimes it's hard to tell if you have pushed them or not but at the same time they are cool and have a cutting-edge appeal. Some people have mentioned that they don't care for the remote but I find it to be very adequate and easy to use. I like the larger size of the buttons since I have big hands. The remote seems to work well at different angles and distances as well. When I first hooked up the player it did a firmware update and about a week later it notified me that there was a newer firmware and again did an update. It's comforting to see that Samsung is actively working to improve the device's firmware by releasing updates frequently if needed. I didn't know what issues/features the firmware updates were addressing because the UI on the player doesn't really tell you but Samsung does list what the firmware updates change/fix on their website. The device didn't have any problems connecting to my home network using a CAT-5 cable. It doesn't bother me a bit that this player doesn't support wi-fi out of the box. In my experience wi-fi is very susceptible to interference from other devices such as microwaves, cordless phones, and other wi-fi routers so using it to stream a high-definition movie could be problematic when you decide to pop some popcorn during the show or if someone calls you on your cordless phone. You'll always get better streaming performance from CAT-5. Plus, it's a lot cheaper than the players that do have wi-fi built in.  I have used this player to stream Netflix content from my Netflix instant queue. Before having this player we watched a lot of Netflix streaming content on our computer but watching it on the HDTV using this player has been a lot more convenient and sounds better on the home audio system than on the computer speakers. Streaming works very well and I haven't seen it skip frames or stop to re-buffer the stream. It takes a little longer to buffer the stream at the beginning of playback than my computer does but after a 15-20 second wait it's good to go so it's not a big deal. I have spoken with people who stream Netflix through the PS3 or XBOX and they have told me it takes about the same amount of time to buffer on those systems and I would imagine other Blu-ray players that stream Netflix would have similar performance. Some of the Netflix streaming content will stream in 720p resolution which looks and sounds great. One thing to note is that this player will only see titles you have added to your Instant Queue on the Netflix website. You cannot use the player to browse for different content and add it to your queue. This has not been very bothersome to me but it might bother some people. I actually like the fact that I can put titles in the Instant Queue for my children to watch and they can't browse around Netflix on the player and find adult content accidentally in the process.  Streaming music through Pandora has been great too. The Pandora app works well and has a good interface. You can give songs a thumbs up or thumbs down but only while the song is playing. It would be great if you could go back through the list of songs that have recently played and give them the thumbs up or thumbs down after they have played like you can on the Pandora website but that's not the way it works sadly. The quality of the audio seems very good and the time it takes to buffer the music is not even noticeable. We have really enjoyed having a device capable of using Pandora connected to the home audio/theater system.  I used the Blockbuster service to rent a movie for my kids. The video/audio quality was excellent and I had no streaming problems but the price was a little absurd. The movies cost about $4 to rent and you only have access to watch the movie for 24 hours from the time you first start playing it. At that price I would expect that you would get to watch the title as much as you want for 5 days just like you would do if you physically rented a movie from a Blockbuster location. I don't think I will be using the Blockbuster service very much unless there is a movie I really want to watch and I'm too tired/lazy to physically go to a Blockbuster and rent it.  Overall I feel like the device does a lot for how much I paid for it and is definitely worth the money. I have already recommended it to numerous friends and co-workers who have been looking to get a Blu-ray player. This is the first Blu-ray player I have owned and might possibly be the last since it's so feature-rich and works so well.  Update 4/14/2010:  I have had this player for over a month now and I have received 4 firmware updates I think. With the firmware updates the device has only gotten better. The updates didn't appear to add any new features but they have made the player more stable so it is less likely to freeze-up or stop working in other ways. Everything has been working flawlessly for me.  There is a new service called Vudu now that this player supports. I have not tried to use it yet but it appears to give you one free HD rental so that you can try the service. It looks similar to the Blockbuster streaming app. Most movies appear to have options to rent/buy the title in 3 different formats. HDX (1080p 5.1 Surround), HD (720p 5.1 Surround?), and SD (Standard Definition 480p and I'm not sure on the audio). I have watched a few trailers on Vudu and they stream fine but I haven't tried actually streaming a movie from Vudu yet.

The color is perfect and spatters clean off the finish easily.  The cover fits securely.  The water tastes fresh and clean, unlike another metal kettle I purchased some time ago which imparted an unpleasant taste to the water.  All in all, I'm very happy with it. I would recommend this item to anyone who wishes to purchase it.  Thanks Kitchenaid for a quality product.

Thwarted in his love for his childhood soulmate, Catherine Earnshaw, Heathcliff turns his devastation outward, becoming a hateful -- and hated -- person all across the bleak moors that surround his Yorkshire village.   Heathcliff courts and marries the sister of the man whom Catherine chose over Heathcliff, only to torture her emotionally as a way of getting even with her brother. Meanwhile, Catherine slowly wastes away pining for Heathcliff, for although she once rejected him, she eventually realizes that she has made an irredeemable error and can never be happy. Heathcliff sums up the tragedy of their lives in a single question near the end of the novel when he asks, "Why did you betray your heart, Cathy?"   Sound depressing? It's not. Wuthering Heights is a grand and glorious novel that dramatically illustrates the power of love, for good and ill. But more importantly, it teaches us that the only path to happiness is to be true to one's heart, rather than one's head. Had Catherine honored her bond with Heathcliff and refused to bow to the social mores of her day, not only would the two of them been much happier, but all of the many people whose lives they stumbled into would have been much better off.   Another reviewer said that those of us who love this novel probably have a strong identification with one of the characters, and for me that is quite true. That's the reason for reading a classic like Wuthering Heights, because when it speaks to you in the clear and true way that Bronte does, you know that you are not alone, and that some things transcend time and place.   Think about it -- a prim, Victorian preacher's daughter living on the moors of England before there was electricity can reach across 150 years of time and speak to the heart of a wired American in the 21st century. Pretty amazing, and highly recommended.

I have tried many other games but Halo is the only one that doesn't tax me too much with choices and complicated controller requirements.  I give the Halo franchise 5 stars because it is so simple, one mission, kill everything in sight.  You don't need to investigate, open your pouch, choose between a million weapons, read maps, or think for even a second. It's the only game I've found which I can stand for more than 5 minutes and which is completely uncomplicated. And you can skip the story and all that nonsense by just hitting the main button.    As compared to other Halos:  I'm not crazy about the weaponry.  The needlers run out of ammo and the other guns don't do much. You also need to press a button to reload some weapons, it seems, whereas before they would reload if you walked over the same kind of weapon.  THere are 3 kinds of grenades, which is unnecessary and just harder to switch between.  You can also only carry 2 of each instead of 4.  Since the new grenades stick like the plasmas, they don't add much and just add another layer of choice and button-pushing.  Too complicated.  Also, the little bonus things like flares and landmines are gimmicky and add too much comlpication.  Again, advanced gamers probably love it, but I'm too old to learn all this new stuff.  Just give me a gun and some grenades.    In previous games you'd come across more types of things to do, like a lot of sniper rifles so you could sit on a hilltop picking off aliens or use other strategy.  In this game you don't find a lot of useful weapons, so there's a lot more direct hand to hand, on the ground type combat.  I've also found that it's easier to kill things and easier in general to solve the levels.  Also, it uses the "follow me" arrow and the voice gives you suggestions if you seem to be missing the point, which I like, since in previous Halos I've spent hours wandering around wondering what I'm supposed to be doing.  No such problems here.  They've sufficiently dumbed it down.    I've had a few graphic glitches in this one, which has never happened before.  I've also gotten stuck and unable to get out of things twice.  THe sound and graphics are great, of course. I've never paid any attention to the story, unless it required me to, so I can't comment on that.  Kusdos to Bungie for making it easy to skip over.    Overall, this is the same experience as the others, though it seems easier than Halo2.  As little thought as that required, this one requires less. I've not had to think at all about weapon choice, strategy, or anything,  Just pull the trigger and kill!  I wish there were more FPS games like this -- fast-paced, completely intuitive hand controls, easy storyline, simple mission, and FUN.

With no attempt being made to hide her right-wing bias, she is unashamedly blunt about her views, often coating them in biting repartee. It seems that each time Coulter opens her mouth (or posts another column on her website), the mainstream media screams that she's "done it this time!" Yet her books are bestsellers, and she continues to be published. As she points out, if she's so over-the-top, why are people continuing to read her work?   In her sixth book, "If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans," Ann assembles a collection of her most famous quotes, columns, and interviews on subjects from airport security to taxes, and everything in between. Each chapter contains a brief commentary on the subject, followed by a collection of dated quotes illustrating her beliefs and opinions.   I must admit that, in the past, I have stayed away from political non-fiction. As a conservative Republican, I have found much of it to be in disagreement with my personal views on matters, and I like reading as a way to escape the seriousness of my everyday life. But as I thumbed through a copy of this book at Borders a week ago, I knew I had to read it. Coulter's wit and humor make the book a fast read, and her comments are intelligent enough to get you thinking while funny enough to make you laugh. And, while I can't say that I agree with her viewpoints on everything, I agree enough to have made this book worth my time.  If you are not a conservative, do not agree with Ann's points of view, or are a liberal Democrat, then you probably will not enjoy this book. If, however, you do enjoy reading an intelligent yet witty commentary on the current state of political affairs in the United States (with an admittedly right-wing voice), this book is for you.

Thus, I did a lot of research on good DVDs and some essential "props" and over the past few months have purchased about 12 DVDs from TaeBo to PIlates to the Biggest Loser series, and then I saw this new one from Jillian, and it surpassed everything else I own by far. I have been working out pretty regularly for over 10 years, I've done triathlon's and everything from spinning to running to kickboxing, so I figured I could start at Level 3. After 3 minutes I went down to Level 2, and then another five minutes to Level 1!!! I have been doing Level 1 for a week and think I will be able to progress a level each week, but it is truly a challenging and rewarding workout, and I highly recommend it for people who enjoy maximum results in minimal time (and don't mind sweating and feel like they might have a heart attack!)

I also feel like the characters spent most of the book displaying or explainint their characterization rather than just "being themselves." However, it was a very enthralling story. It grabs the reader's interest and doesn't let go. Anyone who has an interest in art, history, or even cospiracy theories would like this book. I'm not saying that everything in the book is historical fact...don't get me wrong...but some of it is. There is a lot of factual information in the book...especially concerning Leonardo Da Vinci. I would recommend reading the Illustrated Edition, especially for anyone who is unfamiliar with a lot of art. This edition includes photographs of all of the paintings, sculptures, buildings, and drawings that are mentioned in the book. It is extremely helpful in understanding what is being read.

I've realized that the time I spend doing my product comparisons is often time that others don't have so I may as well share what I can.   I'll start by saying that you'll see my "Verified Amazon Purchase" on the Flip HD Ultra Camcorder review because, obviously, that's the one I wound up buying and I'll share with you why. But what I like in a camcorder may not suit your own needs so I'll break it down and let you decide what's best for you via what I found out:   Here are the pocket camcorders I compared:   Flip UltraHD (will be referred to as "F")  Flip Mino HD 2nd generation (Will be referred to as "M")  Creative Labs Vado HD 8 GB 2nd generation (Will be referred to as "CL")  Kodak Zi6 Pocket HD (Will be referred to as "K")   Why HD cameras only? Brighter colors and better images, wider images     HD SHOOTING TIME:  F: 120 minutes.  M: 120 minutes  CL:120 minutes  K: 25 minutes with batteries they included, 120 minutes if you buy an SD card   MEMORY:  F: 8 GB  M:8 GB  CL: 8 GB  K: internally only 30 MB recording space but it has 32 GB expandable SD/SDHC card slot. Because it comes with such small recording space you really need to buy an SD or SDHC card to maximize its potential, but the potential is really good and this will increase your ability to shoot longer.    RESOLUTION:  All 720p which is excellent, just one step below the top 1080p format.   MICROPHONE:  F: Stereo  M: Mono **Update** They are now putting Stereo Mics in the Minos as of 2010. CL: Mono  K: Mono   SOUND:  F:Premier AAC audio. Best stereo sound quality but still not great in winds  M:Good sound quality. Still not good in winds.  CL:Poor sound quality; had issues with sound and picture not being in sync.  K:Poor sound quality    ZOOM:  F: 2x  M:2x  CL:2x  K: poor quality zoom on the one I tried but I still think it's 2x. It has a great macro focus for very close-up objects if, for example, you see a bumble bee and want to shoot it on a leaf a few inches away! Kinda cool.   CAMERA SIZE AND WEIGHT:  F: 4.3x2.2x1.2 4 oz  M: 3.9x2x0.6 3. 3 oz  CL: 3.9x3x0.6 3.5 oz  K: 5.5x2.5.0.9 5.6 oz   SHIPPING SIZE AND WEIGHT:  F: 6.2 x 3.1 x 3.1 inches ; 11.2 ounces  M: 2 x 0.7 x 3.9 inches ; 1 pound  CL: 3.3 x 7.9 x 6.3 inches ; 11.2 ounces  K: 4x 5x 2.5" 2.4 lbs    TECHNICAL DETAILS:  F: USB cable pops out of the back so you don't need to keep up with a separate cable. Comes with Flip Video rechargeable AA battery pack (recharges when connected to USB); also supported by standard AA batteries. Note: Some sets come with the HDMi mini included and others come with the rechargeable battery pack on Amazon. Looks like one or the other but of course if you need both you can buy the other.  M: USB cable pops out of the back on this one as well. Has child safe button to prevent accidental deletion of videos. Internal lithium ion battery recharges through built-in USB arm  CL: USB in camcorder. Included in box are HDMI cable (nice), USB extension cable,(nice)silicon skin (cool) & rechargeable battery.  K: Included in box are HD and AV cables and wrist strap and rechargeable batteries and battery charger. Has built in USB arm.   SPEED:  F: 30 frames per second.  M: 30 frames per second  CL: 30 frames per second  K: choice of 30 frames per second or 60 frames per second.   VIEWING SCREEN: All 2" except the Kodak was the largest at 2.4"    IMPORTANT NOTES:  F: Best low-light performance for the mini cameras (though not perfect at all) and least amount of blurring and dropped frames in my opinion. Best color. Only one with stereo sound. You can get an underwater case for this one! Though that may sound crazy for a Texan, we use the camera non-stop on vacations and even when we aren't IN the water, we are around the water...on boats, in the sand with sea mist, etc. Then we can dive in and record the fish. Comes preloaded with flipshare software...just plug in to computer and it pops up. Only one with stereo sound. M: Colors don't appear as good on the Mino as the other cameras. Thinnest camera. Make sure you get the one that only comes in the color aluminum or brushed metal. If it comes in any other colors it is the 1st generation MinoHD and they improved upon that one in the newer models. Great audio. Better shooting in low light than most mini cameras. Camera comes preloaded with FlipShare software. Can get still images through flipshare software.  CL: Decent filming in low light but not nearly as good as the Ultra or Mino; Software is preloaded in camcorder.  K: This is the only camera that I compared without the built in image stabilizatin which corrects for shaky images. What appears to be metal in picture is actually a chrome colored plastic. That said, this had the largest viewing screen of all of them. 2.4" Very poor in low light and seemed to have far more shaking and blurring. It also takes still pictures but they are really really poor quality...same as a lesser-quality cell phone pictures but good in a pinch if you want a still shot and have no cell or camera I s'pose. Heaviest for a pocket camera. Software is not preloaded in camcorder but a cd comes with it.    HOW CNET'S EDITORS RATED THE CAMERAS:  F Excellent  M Excellent  CL Very Good  K Very Good   And, finally, the reviews of the Flip from experts swayed me quite a bit:  Fast Company: "Flip Ultra HD is Pure Digital's "Best Pocket Camcorder Yet." 6-09   USA Today: "New Flip Ultra Video Cameras Might Flip Your Switch" 4-09   Business Week: How do you Invigorate a Recession? Look to i-phone, Flip, Kindle, and Zip Car For Answers   There were lootttts more I came across when researching the Flip Ultra HD but those are some of my favorites.     CONCLUSION: Clearest picture and sound was important to me, expert reviews that pointed to the Flip UltraHD as well and I liked the built in software and the case I can get to shoot underwater. It is the number one selling camcorder as well. So that was my personal decision-making process. However, keep in mind that if you need reading glasses none of that will matter if the 2" screen is too small for your viewing the shots easily for playback in which case you may wish to get the Kodak if that's important to you..   Also: No matter which one you get, you will probably want a mini tripod if you ever want to be in the shot yourself do don't forget those.   Also note: It's confusing because when these manufacturers make changes in the camcorders, they do not change the names on the new versions, nor do they change the names if it's an HD version or a non-HD version so be sure you look for the "HD" after the brand name and look for "2nd generation" or "newer version" on the Mino and Vado if you like one of those better so you don't get the older models.    Hope my obsessive comparing and contrasting for my own purchasing assistance helped you as well even if what you wanted in a camera was different from me. :-)

I have to say this Lego game is pretty good now that I have played it for a few days.  My only real complaint is that unlike the previous Lego DS games you CANNOT use the buttons on the right to perform any of the spells like you could in the Lego Star Wars and Indiana Jones games to perform stunts, punch, etc.  For this game you must use the stylus because of how the "spells" are performed. I found it a little annoying at first, but now it seems completely natural.  And since you need the stylus out to do any of the spells you find it is easier to "guide" Harry or whoever around the game instead of using the directional keys to walk your character around like in the previous games.  I can see this being where the dizzy feeling can occur until you get used it.    I also agree about the sensitivity in using the stylus and either changing characters or doing the spinning stun thing in error time after time.

As such it is as close to being a legendary book as they come, yet some seventy five years after its initial publication, it still offers a story that is also surprisingly fresh, personal, and memorable. For all of his obvious excesses, Hemingway was an artist compelled to delve deliberately into painful truths, and he attempted to do so with a style of writing that cut away all of the frills and artifice, so that at it s heart this novel is meant as a exploration into what it means to be adult and alive. Thus we are introduced to Jake Barnes, a veteran of World War One, now forced by his wounds to live as a man without the ability to act like one, forced by impotence to forgo all of life's usual intimacies, and all of its associated life connections for which he so yearns. At the same time, Jake attempts to live a life of meaning and purpose, one crammed full with activity, work, and friendships. Yet it is within this network of friendships and connections that he must confront his painful circumstances.  Enter his true love, the feckless Lady Ashley, and indeed the plot thickens, for we soon see how Jake's physical affliction has painfully affected several others. Ashley loves him, but needs a virile man who can give her the physical love she needs. While Ashley is a woman of uncommon beauty, she is also virtuous enough in her won way to want the one man she truly loves to be her lover. Like all of us, she wants most that which she can never have, and so she returns to the source of her own dilemma time after time to Jake, her emotional match, the one man who cannot give her the mature emotional love she craves. So they are condemned to circle around each other, even while some of their friends and other members of the in-crowd interfere, compete, and seek Ashley's affections around the edges of the continuing affair. What we are left with is a modern tragedy, one in which the characters must somehow resolve the irresolvable.  Yet for all this emotional turmoil and existential `sturm-und-drang' of the so-called "lost generation", people drowning in the moral anomie and circumstantial wasteland created in the gutters of their own endless wants and needs, it is most often Hemingway's imaginative and spare use of the language itself that wins the reader over. Unlike his predecessors, he sought a lean narrative style that cut away at all the flowery description and endless adjectives. In the process of parsing away the excesses, Hemingway created a clear, simple and quite declarative prose style that was truly both modern and revolutionary. What one encounters as a result is a story seemingly stripped to its barest essentials, superficially more like the newspaper man's pantheon of who, what, where, when, and why, and yet somehow transformed into a much more accurate and imaginative effort, one leaving the reader with a much more artful account of what is going on. One reads Hemingway quickly, at least at first, when one learns to slow down and drink in every word and every detail as it is related. For me and for millions of others, the true genius of Hemingway is to be found in his artful use of language. This book was Hemingway's first truly successful foray into the world of letters, and the result changed the face of modern fiction.  Enjoy!

There is a big problem with most inclusive systems, this has all the benefits, best of both worlds. boasting a staggering 5 HDMI inputs, it has specific steetings for T.V., music, and multiple gaming settings from Action and RPG to Rock and Sports....which is very cool! Ii has an iPod dock, which I was happy to see that you can play movies off of the ipod with no resolution issues. I haven't used the tunner yet, really no need. Really easy lay out, looks great. FYI the subwoofer is HUGE! I thought it would fit on the lower self on my entertainment system.....not going to happen. SUPER AWESOME unlike the other system it play music every bit as good as my brothers Dennon which he dropped almost $2K on.

Many users seem to think that this camera was designed to compete with expensive, professional cameras that cost thousands of dollars and produce full HD quality video.  That's not what this is. Also, while my camera hasn't had the 'noise' issue from the Mic, i have seen a camera that had the issue and its BARELY noticeable.  Its almost like a very quiet background noise from a Florescent light or something.  Kodak has designed, marketed, and built a camera to compete with FLiP and has clearly produced a FAR better product.  I'll keep it short and sweet and first explain who I am and what I am using this camera for.  I use it for:  -Home Videos/Fun stuff with old buddies and friends -For work when I need some quick video that's easy to upload online, or put in iMovie and edit -For work when I need more complex videos that may require editing, or somewhat lengthy video but I want the ease of use/portability.  I have seen some of the problems stated with the internal Mic and I have had none of them (I do have the upgraded Firmware that is now standard 1.03, and Kodak says this completely eliminates the issue...again have never had the issue on my camera).  A relative of mine was lucky enough to purchase this product when Kodak did an 'early' release a few months ago and occasionally his videos will have a bit of a higher pitched background noise, but it doesn't interfere with the sound from the video -- its just a light background noise that, honestly, i've heard on dozens of cameras.  Don't forget, without an external Mic the camera only records mono so -- the sounds quality isn't going to be great anyway!  The video is great, image stability isn't as advanced as those available on more expensive cameras but it is better than anything i've seen in a FLiP or other Kodak model.  It does work and you can see a difference, even if its not huge.   Its SO easy to flip between video modes.  The 1080p is awesome, but sometimes its nice to move back down to 720 and the 60fps to capture 'action' footage.    One negative -- which most people may see as a positive -- i do wish there were more settings, or at least the ability to play around with more features/edit modes.  Its GREAT easy to use, its a point and shoot video camera -- but with the great lens and abilities, it seems like Kodak could have -- pretty easily -- had this camera competing with much higher end cameras. If all the hardware was put to great use this could compete with $500+ cameras.  But I understand wanting to keep it simple.  I like having the SD card.  Some people would prefer the internal memory, and yes by the time you buy a decent sized SD card the camera is more expensive than the FLiP, but, the FLiP has a very limited memory.  This camera is limited only by the size of the card...Definitely a positive!  Finally, I know people that are both in the TV business and do a lot of Video blogging and they are drooling over this camera because of the external mic capabilities. One reason lots of 'pros' didn't like FLiP was because of the audio issues.  Kodak has solved those, not to mention providing better quality video.  Again this isn't something to shoot with if your a young film-maker or a die-hard amateur cinematographer.  But if you need something cheap to get some great quality video, or need something super easy to use that is really portable....Take the plunge. And if your considering FLiP -- don't bother...

Assembly was really simple except for the seat bar, you almost need two people for that one to balance it out...but I got it on with some patience. Everything was easy to put together and the machine looks incredible!  Now I have worked out on free weights for over 8 years now, getting the Bowflex was a big step for me, but I wanted a gym at home instead of joining a gym and wasting money on membership fees and having to wait in line for the weight area to become free. The first exercise I did was bench press, I was immediately impressed by how great the machine made my muscles contract. My arms shook a lot in the beginning probably because I was not used to doing bench press without a bar, but I got down to the rhythm of it in just a few repetitions. After using the machine and getting an amazing ab workout, I woke up this morning feeling like a truck hit me...which is exactly how I like to feel the morning after a good workout! Sore is a good sign that the machine works! My max on bench press is 275 pounds and 285 on decline, so for a machine that has a max weight of 210 pounds to give me a great workout is just what I was looking for.  I would recommend this machine to anyone because 1.) The price you can not beat with free shipping and no tax 2.) It works your body just like free weights do 3.) You will probably spend the same amount that you pay for this thing over a two year period with a gym that does not belong to you at all 4.) MOST IMPORTANTLY!!! You can work out at home ANYTIME you want and not have to worry about how you look, the weather or the extra expense of driving all the way over there! I think this is a great product, and so far it has made my entire body sore, exactly what I was looking for. I hope the review helps :-).

And from the sound of "In Rainbows," Radiohead has decided not to let their reputation loom over them -- and I'm not just talking about the online digital release. In their latest album, they reinvent their bittersweet pop sound -- they lose some of the trappings of their past work, in favour of warmer, more intimate melodies and traditional instrumentation.  It opens on an angular note with "15 Steps," which is built around a jagged riff.The first couple minutes are full of fuzzy synth stabs and sharp drums, sounding like a jazz number that's being eaten by a computer. "How come I end up where I started?/How come I end up where I went wrong?" Thom Yorke sings mournfully. "You reel me out then you cut the string..."  But then the guitars slide in and twine through the song, softening it into something very different. The scratchy synth beats and subtle guitar start building to a slow crescendo, staying energetic and almost reggae-esque right to the end.  See it as kind of a transition song for Radiohead; they're easing listeners into their new acoustic sound, rather than just dropping us in. But after that, they pretty much leave the "Kid A" territory behind them -- "Bodysnatchers" is an intense rocker brimming with chunky riffs and softly ringing guitars. It's a gorgeous piece.   After that, the songs gently slip down into more introspective territory -- smooth, dark pop songs wrapped in a heavy blanket of fluid strings and subtle slide guitar. Some of these are dressed up in thick guitars and clattery drums. "Jigsaw Falling Into Place drops the strings for a vibrant guitar-rocker edged with synth, and it all finished up with the quivering, melodic finale "Videotape."  You know, I didn't think that Radiohead could surprise me. So many bands get mired in their best-known sound, and they keep turning out the same ol' because that is what the fans expect. But Radiohead has not only made an exquisitely bittersweet pop album, but they've also injected vitality back into their sound. They sound brand new.  Particularly, they've almost abandoned the cool, alien synth of their last few albums. It's still there in patches, but it's quietly overwhelmed by the layers of slide guitar, streams of piano, and smooth sweeps of elegant strings. These are seamlessly woven with  clattering drums and cymbals, thick crunchy riffs. And yes, occasionally a little speck of synth.  But their songwriting is much the same -- simple, yet oblique ("I am a moth who just wants to share your light... I only stick with you because there are no others/You are all I need"). While Yorke's trademark wail is still in place, he sounds more melancholy and contemplative than outright woe-is-me angsty. He even sounds a bit cheerful in "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi."  Most long-standing bands can't summon up a new sound, and new freshness, this far into their careers. But Radiohead have created a quiet little masterpiece in "In Rainbows" -- beautiful, quiet, and melancholy.

First things first, I am not a techie. I am someone who uses Word, Excel and PowerPoint on a very regular basis, who really liked some of the changes in Office 2007 but who thought some things needed tweaking, so when given the opportunity for the beta edition I jumped on it and have not been disappointed. Office 2010 is to Office 2007 what Windows 7 was to Vista; that is, there are not many breakthrough, drastically different features, but a whole lot of polishing and cleanup to make it easier and more efficient.  Overall, the program seems to run faster, incorporates many of the most commonly used options and makes them more accessible (eliminating many dialog boxes and tabs) and allows for more customization.  At first glance it looks very much like its predecessor, the ribbon is back and it is now also found on OneNote.  There are plenty of sites that will give you a play-by-play on all the features available in this new version, so I'm just going to mention some of the biggest improvements that I've seen.         1)	The biggest change is the addition of the web apps.  It may not be a true direct competitor to google docs, but it   allows for easier sharing of documents, as well as making your documents more accessible.        2)	The ribbon is back and it now includes the "File" option and a new feature called "Backstage view."  Backstage view incorporates the most commonly used actions in one place (yay! no more dialog boxes with tabs).  You get the usual open, save and print, but you also get several templates for new documents, print layouts and ways to share your work, all without dialog boxes and tabs, everything is much more easily accessible.       3)	Another new feature is that the ribbon is now customizable so you can organize it according to your needs.        4)	There is a Paste Preview which lets you switch between paste options so you can make sure that your work will be formatted correctly.  Changes in PowerPoint. You can now edit video directly on PowerPoint. You can trim a video, add effects, fades and even triggers for animations for the presentation.  Another new feature is that you can add effects and edit images without the need for third party software.  Changes in Word. One nifty new feature in Word is called "Navigation pane," which replaces the old document map. It incorporates minor changes in design that make big changes in productivity and ease of use. It allows you to quickly rearrange the document. Take for example a document with several headings/sections.  The Navigation pane provides a list of all the headings.  The headings are live, so you can drag them up or down, thus rearranging the document.  It also incorporates most of the functions that used to be available in the "Find" dialog box but now they are all visible so you don't have to go digging through several menus to find the option that you need.  Changes in Excel. Most of the changes in Excel deal with very large datasets. There is a new PowerPivot add-in which works great if you are dealing with a very large dataset that does not fit in one Excel spreadsheet. PowerPivot pulls the data from multiple sources (several Excel spreadsheets for instance) to analyze it.  Summary: Overall this is one well planned and executed upgrade that essentially takes all the promises of Office 2007 and makes them a reality. Yes, some things are different, and it will take some getting used to; but, once you realize the improvement in efficiency you'll agree that the changes are mostly for the positive.   The only thing that I truly wish had changed but didn't is that this version does not include Outlook. That is available in the Home and Business version.

The extras are hilarious (Gettin' It Dunn is a personal favorite) and of course the episodes are unforgettable. The only beef I have with this DvD is that it has no commentary. T&EASGJ! season 1 had commentary on the DvD and I loved it, season 2 and 3 don't and I wish they did. However this is still a sweet DvD so get it.

Margaritas are his favorite drink and he just couldn't duplicate that restaurant quality consistancy with a blender. This Margaritaville machine actually shaves the ice instead of chopping it like a blender would do. This creates that nice smooth consistancy of the drink instead of a lumpy texture.   It's very easy to operate. All you do is fill the ice chamber with ice, pour the correct amout of your drink mixture into the pitcher (it will make 1-3 servings at a time), set the machine to how many servings you would like, then turn it on. The machine automatically measure,shaves and blend the perfect amount of ice according to the amount of servings. No more watery drinks.  When my kids have friends over for pool parties they love me to make them alcohol free strawberry daiquiris or pina coladas or fruit smoothies.   One nice feature about this machine is that as the ice in the ice chamber melts, the water is channeled into a collection reservoir, that is easily removeable to dump out. The water never mixes with the drink mix.  Clean-up is simple. Whatever ice remains in the ice chamber can be left to melt and drain into the reservoir then discard it or you can have the machine shave the remaining ice into the pitcher. We put our pitcher and pitcher parts into the dishwasher for a good cleaning.  If you are a frozen drink lover, like my husband and I are you have to own one of these. It's pricey but worth it!  I also, highly recommend the canvas carrying case that can be purchased separately. It's very nicely made.

While FUNimation has confirmed that 1.01 was the beginning of four rebuilt feature film releases, 1.11 isn't the second one but rather 1.01 again with some of its lighting (lack thereof) issues addressed, the addition of 2-minutes of new scenes and a second disc including a bunch of extra material.  Hard facts first: The release is comprised of a two-disc set, with the feature presentation now coming in at comes in at 100-minutes with an appropriate PG-13 rating due to animated action, violence and some ambiguous nudity.   Language options are standard sub & dub fair, which means the viewer is given the option of running the original Japanese dialog track or an English dub, either of which is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound. The option to turn on English subtitles exists for either language choice as well.   Extras are quite robust and occupy the entire second disc.  Included: Rebuild of Evangelion: 1.01 (Shiro Sagisu Version, Joseph-Maurice Ravel Version), "Angel of Doom" Promotional Music Video, News Flashes, Movie Previews: Preview 1 - Color-corrected version, Beautiful World Version 2, Beautiful World Version 2A, and Beautiful World Version 2B.  The story, while straightforward enough in presentation, has been the source of case studies, web-site devotion, even college thesis throughout the years and hence could never be summarized accurately (with dignity) here. However, to reduce it all down to its most basic levels, a young boy by the name of Shinji is thrust into a world beyond comprehension once an attacking "Angel" comes to town. It turns out that Shinji is one of few individuals in the world who possesses the rare ability to pilot the massive synthetic beings/ weapons known as Evangelions.   Reluctantly he allows himself to submit to the whirlwind of life-changing experiences associated with becoming an Evangelion pilot and makes some new friends and discovers more about his own past in the process. Working for a top-secret, underground (literally) organization known as NERV, Shingi's life as an average 14-year-old is forever lost to the reality that his destiny is to be the one to save all of mankind from imminent doom.   So here it is precisely twelve years since this very material graced Japanese movie screens, you may rightfully be wondering what it is that FUNimation is releasing here. The answer is a bit complex, but I'll do my best to set it straight.   Way back in October of 1995, the animated television series Neon Genesis Evangelion made its television debut in Japan. Two years later the work was "rebuilt" into a theatrical release that essentially spliced together the key moments of the tale into a larger, single effort. The mission was a success but kind of like what George Lucas has done with his Star Wars franchise, the creators behind the property always felt as though the technology available at the time wasn't quite where they would have liked it to be to accurately present the tale visually. Hence in 2007, the material was revisited once more, this time not simply remastering from the original film stock, but rather breaking the material down into its raw form so as to correct and readjust even the smallest imperfections such as animation density and errant particles as a result of using film. It was not so much an exercise of splicing new CGI effects and eye-candy into the original material as it was about using modern animation methods to perfect the look and feel of the original material. As an added bonus the CG elements allow for visual flair that was, at the time, quite impossible to achieve.   Hence that brings us back to this, the 1.11 release, which is the second official North American release of this rebuilt movie series (it is scheduled to be presented in 4 parts total, with the third and fourth parts being released together). Obviously, part 1.11 represents the introduction to the story.   If the timeline appears confusing, rest assured that sorting it all out is by no means a prerequisite to enjoying the film. It starts quickly with very little time spent establishing back-story and sweeps the viewer into a truly unique world where the precision and color pallet of modern computer generated animation melds seamlessly with the unique look of hand-drawn cells of yesteryear.   Plot wise, the tale is brisk and wonderfully entertaining with battle sequence on the absolute grandest scale broken up by moments of genuine character-development and emotional attachment. Perhaps the greatest of these being the sexual tension that exists between the lead characters or the appearances of the enigmatic father of young Shinji.   Fans, detractors, and scholars alike have gone to great lengths in drawing parallels and comparisons to Evangelion's symbolism throughout the years and yet agreement to or even knowledge of these theories is by no means necessary to come away from the film with satisfaction.   In fact, it has actually surprised me in revisiting this film (which is actually made up of the first six episodes of the original television series) at how much of an influence Evangelion has had over subsequent Giant Robot anime franchises like RahXephon and Aquarion. The show is rife with familiar archetypes such as the young boy being thrust into the role of humanity's savior, the biomechanical weaponry/ interfaces, the enigmatic villains that refuse to reveal their intentions, the impassive corporation behind it all, and the dysfunctional family structure that makes the antagonist question his very purpose of existence. Evnagelion is essentially the framework from which all others have followed.   The direction is simply wonderful with the structure of the film being more an endless succession of perfectly framed scenes than a random display of visuals. The voice acting is also quite notable whether you choose to enjoy the original Japanese dialog track (which is spectacular by the way) or the freshly dubbed English track featuring the talents of some of FUNimation's finest performers. Either option represents the perfect accompaniment to the impeccable visual work.   In all this release marks the beginning of a franchise that has been deserving of revalidation for quite some time. The approach taken with rebuilding the film from the basic elements must surely have been quite an undertaking for all involved but I can attest that the finished product simply oozes with hints of the level of perfectionism sought out in the process. Amazing things are truly possible when such a revered and definitive property receives the loving caress of modern technology's capabilities. Considering the asking price of the new build isn't much higher than the extra-feature-less 1.01 release, this is the recommended choice.

One, someone familiar with the show--perhaps saw it and liked it or has the soundtrack--and wants to check out this variation.  Or two, someone discovering it anew.  It tempts me to write two reviews because while I love "Jekyll & Hyde", it's slightly unfortunate that this is the production most people will get a chance to judge.  So let me preface this by saying that I really am a fan of this show.  Some people consider "Jekyll" sort of a "Phantom-lite".  I, myself, have never been the biggest supporter of "Phantom of the Opera".  It's fine, full of bombast, but hardly the revolutionary experience that people give it credit for.  "Jekyll" does play to similar themes, but has a stronger overall soundtrack.  Instead of a couple of showstoppers like "Phantom", "Jekyll" is filled with memorable power ballads.  Not the most complicated show musically, it is very accessible.  And when you have great singers, these simpler and emotionally charged songs become pop opera and quite moving.  So, without hesitation, I recommend the original Broadway Cast recording!!!  Robert Cuccioli, Linda Eder and Christiane Noll are superb.  You couldn't hope for better.  But here's the problem with this DVD, it's not this great cast--NO, the star is David Hasselhoff.  So you see my problem, don't you?  Look, I'm not going to be unkind--it's an easy target.  Let's just say this.  If you're a fan of the show, he doesn't completely ruin it.  And it's not like there are any other versions to add to your collections.  If you are new to the show, I'm still recommending it provisionally.  I wish there were another option.  If you like the show, though--and I think you will--please rush over and buy the 1997 Cast recording.  Treat yourself to how "Jekyll & Hyde" should really sound.    KGHarris, 10/06.

Since then it's popped on and off of people's radars at sparing intervals, and now that it's finally been released, it seems as if Duke Nukem Forever should be only just around the corner. It can then only be described as fortunate that with such a long development period, Alan Wake has turned out to be a compelling and rewarding title to experience.  The game's protagonist holds the title's namesake, and is presented as a highly-successful suspense-thriller novelist who -- with due thanks to an extended case of writer's block -- hasn't managed to put words to paper in the two years since his last release. He and his wife Alice take off to the quaint town of Bright Falls, nestled within the mountains, in an effort to get away from the fast-paced New York lifestyle, and to give Alan a change of scenery and a chance to get over his ailment. After a brief argument between the two, Wake's wife disappears, and the writer begins finding pages to a manuscript for a novel he hasn't written yet. What's worse is that the horrors scribed into the document begin occurring in earnest, and all of this sets off a mystery that's much bigger than Alan Wake himself.  The driving force here is undoubtedly the unyielding fiction backing the whole of the package. There's nothing particularly profound about the narrative, but the means through which it's delivered is striking. The main bits of Alan Wake's story occur through traditional cutscenes, but you as the player will come across transcript pages, radios, and televisions, all of which will give tremendous insight into the past, present, and even future events surrounding your actions. It's not impossible to grasp the entirety of the plot's intricacies without these easter eggs of information, but there's no doubt that they assist incalculably with coloring in the dark and dreary world that would otherwise only be outlined.  There are some very story-centric portions of the game that take place during the daylight hours, but you'll spend the bulk of your time transversing Bright Falls and its outlying woodlands by night. That's when all the spooky stuff happens. There are these dark-enshrouded creatures called the Taken, and there isn't a single one of them that would pass up an opportunity at putting an axe in Wake's spinal column. Fortunately they do have a weakness, that being anything fluorescent in nature, and resultingly you'll spend a lot of time fumbling around with a flashlight. There's nothing overly complex about the gunplay; burn away the darkness surrounding the Taken, and pop them a couple of times with a weapon of choice. There are bigger, badder enemies, but the only variation they apply is the longevity of your aforementioned actions.  It's the simplicity and redundancy of the combat that serve as Alan Wake's only real drawback. Nothing about how you dispose of your night-stalkers ever really changes through the game's ten hour run. There's some stronger enemies, some faster ones, and even some malevolent demon crows to dispatch of. There are some possessed objects that'll fly at you, and a few pieces of heavy farm equipment that make it their sole duty to run you down, but the process undergone to remove the threat is essentially the same regardless. This isn't to say that there's no fun to be had with the shooting; you've got plenty of ways to make things entertaining for yourself, from flare guns, to flashbang grenades, to hunting rifles. But if simply switching out your weapons every once in a while doesn't help you in disguising the action, you're likely to find yourself a little burned out with the repetitive temperament of the rather frequent combat encounters.  There's a thin layer of visual fidelity coating the town of Bright Falls, but all of that mostly emerges during the odd daylight segment. Everything looks pretty good at best, passable at worst. There's some stiffness and irregularities to the character motions, especially when you tell Wake to climb just about anything. The characters usually aren't all that prone at keeping their lips synced with the excellent voice acting, which is distracting during cutscenes.  Where the game is at its best is when it has free aim to showcase its lighting effects. I'm still not sure if they're the best I've seen in a game, or if it just seems that way given how much of a staunch presence they have in the world. Headlights, street lamps, and even the gentle blinking of a computer terminal all stand as beacons of attention as you wander through the roads and forests. You'll even find that bounding through certain of these restore Wake's health and trigger a checkpoint. These effects all invite a sense of hope and an even stronger sense of environment into a world where your primary enemy does its best to conceal both.  It's the strong deliverance of the narrative and a clear sense of place that lend their hand to making Alan Wake the game that it is. The constant conflict with the Taken eventually leaves something to be desired, but that just makes it all the more baffling that the game can get away with being as compelling as it is. There's a good time to be had with Remedy's latest, and there's little to regret about spending the full duration and seeing it through to the end. Just be sure and pack an extra flashlight and revolver, because Wake always seems to be forgetting his.

He even takes it with us on walks around the neighborhood. We have not had any problems with bubbles- you just have to push it continuously to get good bubbles.  You won't get any bubbles if you only walk a step or two then stop.  However, he loves it even when there are no bubbles- he just wants to mow.  I love it because it is sturdy and not at all annoying like some other (talking) mowers on the market.  I would absolutely recommend this toy!!

The controls and plugs are easily accessible and easy to use.  They are very well designed and to my tastes attractive while on display.  They fold up into a little cube for packing. I have wanted an easy way to listen to my iPod Nano while doing other things, like working on my bonsai collection in the garden. Earphones are a pain unless I am driving.  I tried to stream podcasts from my netbook, but the built in speakers were woefully weak, and the form factor was a pain to have to move around.  I'm ordering two more.  They are well built and can plug into any "headphone" output of desktop, laptop, netbook, iPod.  I have one desktop computer without speakers. Now I can have this little unit plugged in for audio and power to the desktop with it perfectly nestled under the LCD, and listen to stuff that I had to use earphones for previously.  You see, I already have two sets of speakers connected to other computers in the same work area for high quality sound should I ever need it.  Music even sounds great on these little speakers.  Get some while you can!

It rocks!  I'd buy a brand new one at this price in a heartbeat.  These are made by Samick, who purchased the Silvertone name to directly sell their guitars in America instead of just building guitars for other manufacturers.  The Epiphone SG Custom was manufactured by Samick for Epiphone/Gibson for a while.  I saw one with exactly the same inspection sticker as my yard-sale Silvertone!  My unit is fairly beat up, but some touch up with a black Sharpie prettied it up quite a bit.  I suspect that the switch was broken when the guitar did a face plant at some point.  Buy a guitar stand if you order one of these.  Despite all of this, the neck on mine was dead-straight after a slight adjustment of the truss rod.  I love mine.  I'll bet you like yours once you get it set up correctly.   I'm eyeing that SSLA-30 Blues Master (http://www.amazon.com/Silvertone-Master-Electric-Guitar-Transparent/dp/B000189YBW) as my next electric guitar.  I'm sold on Silvertone guitars.

Becky always made me cringe because of her actions (I can't watch movies like that either), but Emma had a good, solid head on her. I laughed out loud at Emma's actions, and really empathized with her, whereas I always wanted to sit Becky down and give her a good talking to. The plot was a tad predictable, but so were all the Shopoholic books, and that didn't stop me either! I really enjoy British chic-lit (it's my guilty pleasure), and I hope that Sophie Kinsella keeps writing fun books with engaging characters.

I thought I could live without having an actual keyboard when it comes to texting, but after a week without my Sidekick Keyboard - I decided to ditch my Samsung Eternity for the Blackberry Bold 9700.I was hesitant about purchasing this smart phone because I was never a fan of Blackberry's (RIMM). I had a BB during their initial boom in the early part of the new millennium. However, the poor browser, poor cell phone network, lackluster screen color, non desirable keyboard, awful battery life, whack OS, & lack of T9 predictive text just couldn't win me over.After I realized that I couldn't text on a touch screen phone, unless it was the iPhone. I decided that I must have a cell phone device with an actual qwerty keyboard, if I expect to survive my text message & email addiction.I picked up the Blackberry 9700 with my corporate discount and walked away with a nice high end phone at a very reasonable price. I have to say that I really enjoy the web browser on the new BB. You can zoom in & out with ease. I thought no browser could compare to the iPod Safari besides the Android G1, but after getting this device - I can safely say that this browser is also one of the best. Its right behind the safari and G1. Prior models were confined to small screens, thirty-five dollar internet only data plans, and no ability to zoom in or out. You were subjected to a small screen and reading small text till your eyes was squinting like grandmas.Pros:3GNew Optical Trackpad (Over the old Trackball)Big vibrant screenThreaded Text Messaging3.5 MM headjackNew OS (Runs a bit quicker without the lag time)Decent call qualityExcellent new broswerMini SD up to 32GBUse your songs as ringersWi-FiPersonal Email (Up to 10 accounts can be added)IMThemesApp StoreMy FavsFull HTML Web Browser (Sometimes)Excellent Multimedia Player (Accepts every format possible)Includes 2 chargers (Wall Charger & USB charger)Includes ear phones and carry caseCons:For long time BB users, this device is really just a cosmetic upgrade with a new OS (Flashier Icons)Micro USB (No more Mini USB)Video & Camera (3.2 Megapixel as oppose to 8.0)Cheap plastic rubber casingNon RIMM Consumer Changes Mind!For anyone who has wanted a BB but held off on getting one and want an entry level Blackberry at a decent price - this is the model to get. Everything about it is an upgrade. The device is basically the BB Bold with a different casing. The battery life could still use some more juice. With excessive email checking & non stop texting, the phone usually needs a charge after a day and a half of usage (Sometimes i can go a charge for 2 days before a charge so thats not bad). I did set the brightness of the phone to the lowest brightness available and it has lasted for a little over 2 days with no charge needed. Even on the lowest brightness, the screen is still very bright, sharp, & crisp. And i still do unlimited texting & web browsing. However, AT&T doesn't offer the best mobile minute plans on earth & their data plan is probably one of themost expensive around. They are fully aware that their signal is one of the best & in doing so, make up for it by charging their non-friendly services at non-friendly prices, which usually doesn't offers an abundant amount of minutes, unlimited data, internet, email, text etc will end up costing you a lot!I pay under seventy bucks a month for a decent amount of mins & unlimited everything else. My friend has a similar plan on Verizon, its not unlimited, and her bill is always over a hundred each month.
like	0	In this short but informative, thought-provoking book, Nicholas Carr presents an argument I've long felt to be true on a humanist level, but supports it with considerable scientific research. In fact, he speaks as a longtime computer enthusiast, one who's come to question what he once wholeheartedly embraced ... and even now, he takes care to distinguish between the beneficial & detrimental aspects of the Internet.  The argument in question?  - Greater access to knowledge is not the same as greater knowledge.  - An ever-increasing plethora of facts & data is not the same as wisdom.  - Breadth of knowledge is not the same as depth of knowledge.  - Multitasking is not the same as complexity.  The studies that Carr presents are troubling, to say the least. From what has been gleaned to date, it's clear that the brain retains a certain amount of plasticity throughout life -- that is, it can be reshaped, and the way that we think can be reshaped, for good or for ill. Thus, if the brain is trained to respond to & take pleasure in the faster pace of the digital world, it is reshaped to favor that approach to experiencing the world as a whole. More, it comes to crave that experience, as the body increasingly craves more of anything it's trained to respond to pleasurably & positively. The more you use a drug, the more you need to sustain even the basic rush.  And where does that leave the mind shaped by deep reading? The mind that immerses itself in the universe of a book, rather than simply looking for a few key phrases & paragraphs? The mind that develops through slow, quiet contemplation, mulling over ideas in their entirety, and growing as a result? The mature mind that ponders possibilities & consequences, rather than simply going with the bright, dazzling, digital flow?  Nowhere, it seems.  Carr makes it clear that the digital world, like any other technology that undeniably makes parts of life so much easier, is here to stay. All the more reason, then, to approach it warily, suspiciously, and limit its use whenever possible, since it is so ubiquitous. "Yes, but," many will say, "everything is moving so fast that we've got to adapt to it, keep up with it!" Not unlike the Red Queen commenting that it takes all of one's energy & speed to simply remain in one place while running. But what sort of life is that? How much depth does it really have?  Because some aspects of life -- often the most meaningful & rewarding aspects -- require time & depth. Yet the digital world constantly makes us break it into discrete, interchangeable bits that hurtle us forward so rapidly & inexorably that we simply don't have time to stop & think. And before we know it, we're unwilling & even unable to think. Not in any way that allows true self-awareness in any real context.  Emerson once said (as aptly quoted by Carr), "Things are in the saddle / And ride mankind." The danger is that we'll not only willingly, even eagerly, wear those saddles, but that we'll come to desire them & buckle them on ever more tightly, until we feel naked without them. And we'll gladly pay anything to keep them there, even as we lose the capacity to wonder why we ever put them on in the first place.  Most highly recommended!

In my case, I've read Rush's first book "The Way Things Ought  to Be" and found it to be full of inaccuracies, unsubstantiated and  outrageous claims, and misinformation.  That's not to say Rush is a complete moron because he does put forth some good arguments, but overall,  I think Al Franken proves his case to convince me that Rush is a (big fat)  idiot.  I like this book because it is hysterically funny and quite  entertaining.  Al's wit is dry and sometimes vicious.  I laughed to tears  when I read the chapter about Phil Gramm ("I own more guns than I  need, but not as many as I want.")  He lampoons the right wing, and I  think he does it well.  If you are a conservative with no sense of humor,  you will not like this book.

A bit flimsy for me.   So, overall I'm impressed with this device.  Very fast and a nice looking printer for the price.  I don't think you will be disappointed in purchasing this printer.

The knife could be a little sharper than what it comes as but it is still sharp enough to cut paper. The razor at the top of the blade is very sharp as well. I bought this tool to be stored in my vehicle, I drive many miles every day and my worse nightmare is to witness a car accident and not be able to help the people involved. This tool is a sharp edge, a serrated edge, a seat belt cutter, a very effective pry bar (its greatest feature) and the right angle at the end of the tool can easily break a window with no problem. The sheath that is comes with is absolutely exquisite, I own many knives and this is the best sheath I have for any knife. Another great benefit to this knife is the fact that the handles can be easily removed for maintenance. You can definitely see that this knife is built to last a lifetime of abuse. I think this knife would be best suited for firefighters and police officers or maybe, like myself, the average joe that needs to be able to help when called upon. Like I said before this tool would be very good for camping and outdoor use, you can chop wood or skin an animal. I think of the lack of a point as a plus because it makes for a stronger tool, there's no tip to break off! Buy it, you will show it off to everyone and they are going to want one too!
like	0	Despite heartrending descriptions of sexual abuse, racism, poverty, homeless and much, much, more in modern India, this is an utterly enjoyable picaresque adventure that is one of the best reads of the year. In the hands of another author, the brief life story Ram Mohammad Thomas would probably be told as a simple tearjerker tragedy and the reader would be left to shake their head sorrowfully at the plight of another poor third-world soul. However, Swarup has a gimmick framework up his sleeve, and it works like a charm. Granted, one has to be willing to go along with the premise that this entire structure is based on coincidence of colossal proportions -- readers who aren't willing to suspend disbelief will probably not last more than a few chapters.   We first meet the 18-year-old protagonist in jail, where he sits accused of defrauding the popular TV game show "Who Wants to Be A Billionaire?" (in rupees). Despite being abandoned at birth, uneducated, and left to fend for himself for most of his life, it seems Ram somehow managed to answer the show's twelve questions correctly. To all outside observers, his social standing and lack of education appear to preclude this happening legitimately. However, just as the police are about to unleash some heavy manners on him, a mysterious lawyer intervenes and takes him away. The story then unfolds question by question, as Ram tells her via flashbacks to his life just how he managed to know each answer.  Ram's life story unfolds as a series of episodes ranging from the horrific to the merely tragicomic, and in a sense, one can view him as emblematic of India's lost children, and the book as caustic social commentary on contemporary India. Aside from being abandoned at birth, he must contend with a pedophile priest, a closeted homosexual movie star, a violent, drunken neighbor bent on incest, international espionage, child slavery, numerous thieves, a suicidal employer, and the deaths of several close friends. And yet, despite this bleak subject matter, the intrepid Ram keeps doggedly moving forward and surviving. This isn't done in a sentimental, "triumph of the human sprit", after-school special way, but in a straightforward manner that shows a confused young boy doing whatever it takes to live. And of course, the ultimate moral of the story is that those who keep their eyes and ears open in life can learn a lot about it without any books. An excellent story, well-told, and doubtless to be made into a film.

The comedic talents of the actors are wonderful - their facial expressions were perfect.  The comedy is witty enough that this movie will hold up to multiple repeat viewings.  I would recommend also seeing the Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood first to appreciate the movie more, but it is not essential - Mel Brooks pokes fun enough at real life incidents.   I do know that some people may find this movie offensive (some friends of ours did).  However, in defense of Mel Brooks, he doesn't appear to be advocating any particular lifestyles, just using them as fodder for hopefully the amusement of all.  Parents might want to screen this movie first, as there is a chastity belt, a lustful "cook-witch", and some prisoners give the prison warden the bird.  That said, most of the movie doesn't offend (I don't want to give away too many jokes, but I do want you to cast your vote for the DVD - there are plenty of jokes like Little John falling into two inch deep water and needing to be rescued).  In these times of uncertainty, we need good belly laughs, and this movie provides that.

Track overview. 01.This is an awsome start to any album and blends perfectly with track 2. 02.Don't Stay- A great opener, fast and hard. The chourus grows on you but it is the brigde which stands out and you find yourself yelling with chester. 3.5/5 03.Somewhere I Belong- The single. The intro to this song is so addictive i find myself playing it over and over again. Good song, not the best. 4/5 04.Lying from you-Chester's voice in this song is so powerful and it is impossible not to yell with him. The chorus is again awesome but is let down by the rap. 3.5/5 05.Hit the floor- the major dissapointer of the album. The rap is to similar to previous efforts and the chourus offers very little. 2/5 06.Easier to Run- this chorus is one of the best in the album and blends perfectly with the brige at the end. One of my favourites. 4.5/5 07.Faint- The best song on the album. The intro is incredible and the rap blends so well with chester's chorus. A hard song with the best yelling bridge on the album. 5/5 08 Figure .09- Good song. the chorus isn't as catchy as others but the rap is a stand out. Not original enough. 3/5 09 Breaking the habit- An original an unlike any of their other songs. A quiet song in comparison and the opening scratch with the strings is awesome. Good for a change. 4/5 10.From the Inside- A major stand out. I love this chorus. It has awesome lyrics and is easy to sing with. The best mix of rap and singing to date with an awesome brige. 5/5 11.Nobody's Listening-Again very different.the intro with the pipes sounds sweet. Good rap. Good Chorus. 4/5 12.Session- Dissapointing. Nothing compared to track 11 on hybrid theory where Mr Hahn went off. 1/5 13.Numb- Another great song, easy flowing and again good to sing with. Great lyrics, another favourite, good closer. 4.5/5 *** An awsome album...linkin park has created another masterpeice with every intro being different from the next but being so effective.  Best songs- 03,06,07,10,13

It's a terrific television series with enough depth to surpass most current television cartoons.  If you are familiar with He-Man this set is a way better choice than the 10 best episode collection.  The set includes many of the terrific episodes included in the 10 best and has many that finished just out of the top 10 (as voted by fans and supporters of he-man.org).  The cost of this collection is only 60% more than that of the 10-best and contains nearly five times the material.  Special features are great, and you won't get sick of watching several of these episodes over again.  Also, the stories are wholesome and are not seeking chances for clever inuendos like some current cartoon series, so that they are appropriate for young children as well.

The one I bought was the Vizio: great sound and convenience at a price near the bottom of the range.  The wireless subwoofer is an amazing convenience. Its range is at least 20 feet, and it sounds terrific in a variety of placements.  I connected the soundbar to my HDTV console with an optical cable, which works extremely well with one caveat--to activate the audio, the TV must be set on a digital channel. After that, analog audio (including from a DVD player) comes through as normal. If you use the included conventional cable, no issues.  You have limited control options to tailor the sound, but that's to be expected at the price.  Vizio uses SRS Labs' surround virtualization chip and also throws in its volume stabilizer to knock down loud commercial breaks.  This is a cost sacrifice, as the Dolby and DTS HD audio codecs are much more expensive.  No problem; the others sound thin, while the Vizio washes you with clear, powerful sound.  It's not true surround sound, but unlike some rivals, the audio experience isn't overly directional (sounds good throughout the room) and is much better than basic stereo.  If you can't run wire through your walls to deploy full surround, this is a fine compromise.

Theyve had a great array of awesome albums, slightly altering their sound in the 90s but not as much as some (Ahem Metallica). Their last Greatest Hits release Capitol Punishments was a big disapointment though, mainly containing 90s singles and also 15 tracks including 2 new ones is not enough for a complete Best Of collection. So I had hopes for this one, being fan chosen to deal the goods. In some ways it does but its still lacking some essential songs.   The album is presented in a completely random order but it probably is better then Capital Punishments newest to oldest tracklisting. Again there is more songs chosen from the 90s albums, being there is more of them but this still disapoints me. Only one song Mechanix from KIMB and only one from SFSGSW which definatly needed at least one more. Wheres Mary Jane or even Anarchy in the UK? Peace Sells gets one more song (Wake Up Dead) then it did on Capital Punishment which is pretty good but RIP has exactly the same as it had on Capital Punishment. I definatly would have included one more from that, it is widely regarded as their best album.   Countdown to Extinction recieves 3 songs, Skin O' My Teeth which wasnt included on Capital Punishment but for the life of me i cant figure out why they chose this song over Ashes In Your Mouth which as well as being a far superior song recieved more votes on the [...] forums. But I guess final decision goes. Youthanasia recieves the 2 hits good songs but they dont measure up to Countdown to Extinction. Its great Angry Again was included from the out of print Hidden Treasures. From Cryptic Writings, Trust and She-Wolf. Trust was a big hit and She-Wolf was a fan favourite so its great to see it on here. Risk, the album where they apparently sold out recieves one favourite, Prince of Darkness which is a much better song then the Industrial flavoured Crush Em' that was on Capital Punishment. Next up is Kill the King, one of Mustaines favourites so we all knew it would be included although im not too pleased about it as it was the bonus track on Capital Punishment and not really needed here. Good song though. Then Dread and the Fugitive song, the only song included off The World Needs a Hero. Would have liked to see another song from that album on here because this was included on Capital Punishment as a bonus track as well.  And thats where it ends. Yes nothing off The System Has Failed which is by far their best album since Youthanasia. I dont know what Mustaine was thinking but its obivous a 2cd package was needed to fully display all that Megadeth could be. Wheres Tornado of Souls, Devils Island, Maybe some live tracks or other classic Deth? Kick the Chair, Blackmail the Universe, Die Dead Enough or any song from The System Has Failed? The bonus DVD is all well and good but its pretty much just an extended teaser for the upcoming Arsenal Of Megadeth DVD. Its still a very good hits compilation if you want to get into megadeth or if you are a Megadeth completest but for your average fan its not really worth it. I would personally just skip any Greatest Hits CD and go straight to the studio albums, which is where the magic really happens.

Sadly, for someone who really never learned her lessons and lied about giving back to others on Larry King Live, Paris Hilton showed no effort of changing her ways, and also showed she really doesn't have the drive to act.

like	0	Wow.  I was barely able to put this book down for a second after the first few pages got me completely hooked.  Suzanne Collins narrative here has an immediacy to it that, when combined with the very dramatic life-or-death plot, is incredibly compelling.  It's entertaining, and incredibly disturbing all at once.  If this was merely a good read, I would have given it 4 stars, but they say great art leaves you changed after you experience it...  and this book definitely did that.  Suzanne Collins has, with one amazing work, propelled herself onto my top shelf.  Parents, caveat emptor!  The storyline is brutal.  Even though the writing is geared for young adults, the main characters are teenagers, there's very little physical romance, and the actual violence would probably count as PG-13 nowadays...  it's probably one of the most terrifying books I've read in a very long time!  Right up there with George R.R. Martin, if not more so.  Remember what we learned from Jaws: you don't actually need to SEE the shark in order for it to be terrifying.  Sometimes not seeing the shark is even worse.  The story is basically about a teenager who is forced to compete in a 24-man-enter-1-man-leaves event.  I don't want to spoil it by saying any more, but if you liked The Running Man, you'll definitely like this.  And if you're young enough that you don't remember The Running Man, nor did you get the Thunderdome reference, then I'm just way too old.  But take an old fogey's advice and read this book.    Amazon, when can I preorder book 2???

Cons:  Software could include a couple more options, like alternate soundtrack capability, and the e-mail function is a little vague.  Summation:  Well worth the price.

Dr. Pitcairn provides concise information on dogs and cats from what to feed, to training, and even about how to choose a dog breed for your lifestyle. This book also has lots of natural prevention remedies included and how to PREVENT pesky problems like fleas and ticks from invading your home and your pets.   One of the things I educate pet owners on is prevention being the key and that is done through a strong immune system by feeding and supplementing properly. I always tell them that once your pet is diseased you'll need to see a veterinarian and then undo the illness and disease if you can, then build your pet back up. Dr. Pitcairn shares a lot about prevention and that thrilled me! That is the answer and key to keeping our pets healthy.   He shares about natural feeding which is another big issue I like to tackle with pet owners. He even includes grooming. This is a must have book for any dog or cat owner who wants to approach their pet care naturally and preventatively. Excellent book!   Kim Bloomer [...]

Never mind that the Kraken is from Scandinavian mythology, and that casting Lawrence Olivier as Zeus in the 1981 version was sort of typecasting.  The new Clash of the Titans is a darker, grittier more realistic Bronze age world than the 1981 version, but the story hasn`t changed all that much. The citizens of Argos have become disenchanted with the rule of the Gods. The Gods have caused too much chaos and ruin to their lives so they've decided to take their destinies into their own hands, and destroy the temples and statues of the Gods. In doing so, Perseus'(Sam Worthington) family is killed by a falling statue of Zeus. When Zeus (Liam Neeson) learns of the desecration urged on by Hades (Ralph Fiennes), he decides to destroy the city in four days or they can offer the sacrifice of the King of Argos' daughter Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). In a visit to the throne room of Argos, Hades lets it slip that Perseus is a son of Zeus, a demi-god. Being told of his near divinity, Perseus and a group of soldiers go off on their quest to save the city.  The special effects are great! The monsters look real and the characters realistically interact with them. In 3D the water roiling off the undulating tentacles of the Kraken must look really cool! The problem is they shortchanged the story in favor of the special effects. The story only follows the barest of outlines of the myth. Same with the 1981 version, although it's a little more faithful to the myth. The most glaring lapse is there really isn't any reason for Perseus to save Argos. In the myth his reason to save the city is for the love of Andromeda. In this version he's a stranger to Argos and doesn't fall in love with Andromeda. She's barely a consideration until she's needed to be sacrificed to the Kraken. The only reason he seems to take up the quest is because he's the nearest handy demi-god that can help out. Worthington's Perseus doesn't seem very heroic, there doesn't seem to be any emotional investment in Perseus in either the quest or the surrounding characters. Most of the time he has a stoically sullen, put upon attitude, and this keeps the audience at arms length from the character. He doesn`t seem to embrace the heroic at all. Yes, he kills the monsters, but the tasks he must accomplish like tricking the Stygian witches and figuring out how to survive the encounter with Medusa, he seems to accomplish almost by accident. It seems that Perseus isn't meant to be heroic. he repeatedly says he wants "to do this (the quest) as man, not a God," and he keeps refusing the gifts of the Gods. The message in the myth is for mortals to find the divine, to find the god, the hero within themselves, Perseus' refusal of the gifts of the Gods, is the refusal to find the hero within himself.  The 1981 version, although a bit campy in it's delivery tells the hero's story better. The 2010  version delivers better on the special effects. If such a thing were possible as to merge the strengths of both, you would have a better movie.  DVD/Bonus Features: When Clash of The Titans becomes available on DVD, I'll edit the review to reflect what's included in that package.

like	0	I had imported Demon's Souls in April, and finished it 3 times since then. I have a long review below but if you want a few sentences here it is:   The game has an excellent atmosphere, great character customization, enjoyable combat, some unique online elements, but very little story and minimal npc interaction. It is also very unforgiving, but it is strangely addictive if you don't get frustrated easily. It takes about 40 hours in your first play through. It's not because the game is huge... It's because you'll die a lot and repeat a lot, which results in playing very cautiously (which also adds to the atmosphere).   ***Review***  Demon's Souls is an action RPG game with some unique online elements. I loved the game but I can also see why some people (even RPG lovers) might hate it. Although I gave it 5 stars, I cannot say the game is for everyone. Just read the paragraph at the end where I explain some game mechanics, and if it sounds frustrating to you then might want to try the game first before buying. For me 3 things are very important for an RPG. A good story and well-developed characters, deep character customization, tactical and fun combat.  Story  In DS, the people in different realms/worlds are possessed by demonic souls and you are to get rid of them. When you kill them you collect their souls and get more powerful and eventually fight against the final demon. That's basically it. The game has very little story and minimal amount of non player characters (NPCs). There are about 15-20 NPCs in total (including the merchants and blacksmiths), and most of them are located in a hub called Nexus. Furthermore, you can talk to them but there are no dialogue trees. They'll say 2-3 new sentences after each time you kill a demon boss, giving you some background about the setting. Sometimes they'll initiate a sidequest, by asking you to find/do something. That's all.   If you are expecting something like Mass Effect or JRPGs in terms of story or dialogue this is not it. However, the game has a very dark and immersive atmosphere. It just sucks you in and makes up for its lack of story. Also, sometimes new characters/enemies appear depending on World Tendency (world tendency is something like an alignment that can change toward black or white), which provides replay value.   In sum, unlike most other RPGs, this is not a game that you play for the story. There is minimal story and dialogue, but the game has an excellent atmosphere which gives you the feeling of being alone and overwhelmed.  Character Customization  Character customization is probably the most important aspect of an RPG and this is where the game shines. You start the game with a certain class you picked, but it doesn't restrict you. You can develop your stats in anyway you like and completely turn it into something else (kind of like Oblivion). For example, weapons/armors have different stats requirements, but they are not restricted to classes. As long as your character meets the stats requirement you can use it. So you can mix and mash classes anyway you like. There are 8 different attributes, and when you level up you can raise one of those attributes by one point (there is room for up to 99 for each attribute).   Weapon upgrades are done by using the ores you find. You can do regular upgrades (e.g. long sword +2) or you can change it into a different weapon (e.g. dragon long sword) depending on the ores you found. There are several different types of ores that opens a different upgrade branch. There are also some special upgrades, if you choose to use a demon's soul that you obtained from a boss, which will give you a unique weapon.   Combat  The customization also affects your gameplay. For instance, you can wield double swords, sword and shield, sword and crossbow, sword and a wand, two shields (if you want to be fancy) etc. Moreover, any sword can be wielded two handed or one handed. Of course, if you choose to wield a two handed sword with one hand, you character becomes clumsy. If you choose to wield a one handed sword with two hands, then you make stronger attacks with different animations.   The combat is in real time and it is like an action game. In the controller, L1-L2 is assigned to the left hand, and R1-R2 is assigned to the right hand. L1 is used for guarding, L2 is either for parry (when wielding a shield) or attacking (weapon on left hand)). On the other hand, R1 is regular attack, and R2 is strong attack. You can also roll, run, but you cannot jump. So you end up having different combat gameplay and tactics depending on what you choose to equip.   Online Gameplay  If your PS3 is connected to the internet, you'll automatically play the game online. That lets you do different things. First, you'll see some messages left by other players. They can provide some clues, warnings etc. You can also leave messages but you can only create them by combining preset words and phrases. You cannot type whatever you want. And if someone finds your message helpful and rates it, then your health replenishes. Second, you'll see pools of blood and if you touch them it will show you a ghost of some other player and how he/she died. It's just another clue to help you in the game.   Third, and the most important one, is playing with/against others. If you are in body form, you'll see blue signs on the ground left by other players. By touching those signs you can summon up to two more people to your game and they'll fight along with you in your game helping you out. On the other hand, when you are in body form some other player can invade your game and try to kill you. If you are in soul form, then you can put a blue sign on the ground in order to be summoned by others or you can use an item to invade another player's game.  However, you cannot just invite your friends to your game. If you and your friends are on different servers (which you have no control over) you won't see the signs they left and will not be able to summon them. If you happen to be on the same server, you can arrange a location in the game to put the sign (via XMB message) and then summon the other person.  Conclusion  In sum, Demon's Souls is one of the best games on PS3. It has a great atmosphere and addictive gameplay that makes you come back, even after you died for the tenth time in the same boss battle. Unfortunately it is not a game for the impatient. Just take a look at the cover art (the regular cover art which happens to be the Deluxe Edition cover in US release) of the game. You see a lone, battered knight, who is about to give up. That's Demon's Souls for you. If you are willing to take the challenge, victory will be very satisfying.  ***About the difficulty and potential frustration***  First of all, the game is very unforgiving. Even regular enemies can kill you with 1-2 blows, and they will kill you many times. However that's not the main issue. The real difficulty comes from not being able to save in the middle of a stage/map. The stages don't have checkpoints either. Also dying is very costly. When you die, first you will drop your souls at the location you died (You gain souls by killing enemies, and souls are used as both experience points to improve your stats and also as money). Then you will lose your body (which means losing half of your life bar, making the game even harder) and you will respawn in soul form at the start of the stage. However all the enemies will also respawn. Furthermore, if you die again before reaching the location you died, you will lose all the souls you have dropped previously for good. That means no experience/no money from all that playing. Also reaching your corpse does not give your body back, it only gives back your collected souls. You can gain your body (half of your life bar) if you beat a boss, or invade another player's game and kill him/her, or use a special item.   In brief, you will be playing the same stage from the beginning over and over again, until you beat the boss at the end of the stage. In a lot of cases, you will not gain any experience/level during this process, because you'll die a second time before reaching your corpse. However, the stages are not very big. It generally takes about 5 to 10 minutes to get to the boss if you know the way and IF you don't die. A new respawn point appears at the end of the stage, after a boss is defeated. (The game has 5 worlds and each world has 4 stages/bosses). So, after you beat a boss you can spawn from that location if you want.   Still, a lot of people would probably hate this no save/checkpoint mechanic combined with the games unforgiving difficulty. It's like 80s arcade games which takes you back to the beginning of the stage when you die. 
like	0	I began my search for an LCD HDTV/Monitor over a month ago and purchased 4 other similar items before purchasing this ViewSonic VT2430 and returned the previous 4 for poor performance.  I was actually looking for a unit which included a DVD player for use in training lectures.  But, I couldn't find the right combination so I decided to settle on a unit without the DVD player, since those that are built in are all cheap players.  This way, by keeping the TV and the DVD player separate I can always update the player as needed (BlueRay!).    I looked at a LOT of HDTV/Monitors and chose the VT2430 for its native 1920x1080 pixel resolution.  This works out perfectly with the 1920x1080i signals coming via my cable.  And...the pictures are absolutely stunning!  More so than I even expected, even already knowing the quality of Viewsonic monitors.   And there are plenty of options for modifying and managing the images from all inputs.  One reason for returning a Toshiba unit was that it's native resolution is 1680x1050 pixels, which, when fed a 1920x1080 pixel signal (HDTV) stretches the image vertically...without any way of correcting the distortion.  In fact, the manual states that "image size adjustments are not available with 720i and 1080i signals"!  VERY poor planning as most cable signals are either 790i or 1080i.     The PC image obtained with the VT2430 is absolutely awesome.  I'm typing this review with this monitor with the resolution set at 1920x1080, a perfect match with my PC.  There are at least 10 other resolution settings that work as well - just lower resolution results.  Regardless of the resolution sent from my PC, the VT2430 automatically adjusts for the best picture with each setting.  Very neat.  The audio was another problem I found with all of the other units I tried.  Most of them were either too low in volume or, when the volume was turned up became very distorted.  Not so with the VT2430.  Plenty of clean sound at all volume settings, including loud enough for filling the rooms where I do my training.  The image I get from my (LG) DVD player, which upgrades to a 1080i output via an HDMI cable, is very good.  I also have a BlueRay player which puts out a 1080p signal, which, again, perfectly matches the resolution of the VT2430, for a beautiful picture.    The overall picture of this monitor is far more accurate, clean, and viewable than any of the other monitors I looked at.  The dynamic range is very wide, including the darker colors and grays and blacks, not quite up to my 52-in Samsung (Over $2,300!), but closer than any other comparable sized monitor.    Physically, I like the fact that the monitor can be tilted back for watching from higher positions.  Also, the flat stand can be quickly removed for transporting in its original box, which I do often when I'm training.  Great monitor.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I would, however, downgrade its rating by 1/2 point for not having a DVD player.  But, that is not what it is!  ViewSonic does sell an LCD HDTV/DVD Combo monitor, but it has a lower pixel rate designed more for 720i resolution, which is OK for most uses at this smaller size.  But, having been a TV studio tech in charge of adjusting and maintaining studio monitors, I became too picky and always need(!) the best.

I oil up my arms and legs then I head off in to the bush without fear of bug bites. I spray it on any scratches because I have found that it makes a great disinfectant and wound dressing with very little sting. It's a must for any med kit.  Warning: if you get it in your eyes it will sting for a few seconds until your tears dilutes the oils. It's flavor is NOT lemony.  I'm 38 and I love being, and working, in the woods and brush.

Here are my flyleaf notes--this is a totally worthy book by a real professional with insight.  + Three myths of the House of Bush:  -	Made it on my own -	Not really rich -	Running for office to serve the Nation  + Seven Lessons from the House of Bush  -	Treachery of the press -	Importance of moment -	Money before politics -	Primacy of manners -	NE moderates an endangered species -	Don't give up -	Trust only the family  + The author opens early with his conclusion that George Junior is a Walker (the differences are explained), not a Bush and the rest of the book is a lovely explanation of a family tragedy in three acts:  -	ACT I: the loser struggling to be like Dad and failing -	ACT II: success at being different (drunk, boorish, inept, but different) -	ACT III: descent into mesianism (what happens when a village idiot gets the illusion of power)  + Early on I have a note: national and global catastrophe rooted in a broken family whose black sheep got promoted more than one rung too far.  It must gall the second fiddle that his own mother does not like him and thought the Presidency should have gone to Jeb.  + Despite my extensive reading on the last eight years of high crimes and misdemeanors, this book contains information I have not seen before.  The author hits the reader early on with:  -	Rove, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Rice were "enablers" for George Juniors' idiocy (Powell in my view confused loyalty with integrity) -	The second term flame-out was avoidable--Bush had good intentions but Rove held sway   + The author addresses Bush's faith as false, non-theological, more like "self-help Methodism," using Alcoholics Anonymous meetings instead of church as a group activity.  + There is a superb discussion of the juxtaposition of Bush's linguistic blunders combined with the manner in which he was gifted at using evangelical and conservative code words.  + There is fine coverage of George Juniors meanness and overbearing humiliating toward all, Rove in particular, who accepted every humiliation, including the nickname "Turd Blossom."   + The author summarizes the scandals on Rove's watch: Plume, Katrina, Iraq, firing of prosecutors (I would also add, subversion of Congress in violation of Article one, see Breach of Trust and also Broken Branch).  + We learn in passing that Rove was abandoned three times:  -	By his father who ran away -	By his stepfather who ran away (one of the two was homosexual, I forget which) -	By his mother who committed suicide  + It  was Rove, the author tells us, who pushed privatization of social security.  As I review this book there are ads on the radio that seek to communicate that 40% of America's shares are owned by normal people.  What they do not tell you, which you can lean in John Bogle's book,  The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism , is that we are no longer an ownership society, we have abdicated to financial management intermediaries, and they have skimmed one fifth of the value off for themselves, a select few.  + According to the author it was Rove and not George Junior that pressed for a strategy of demonizing terrorism.  The author says Rove destroyed the Bush II presidency with the "catastrophic blunder of politicizing the War on Terror."  + When the author finally gets around to covering Dick Cheney he casts him perfectly as "Lord Chief Justice" from Henry V, the sycophant who revels in pulling the strings behind the scenes.  I have the line, my own interpretation of the author's words, "played Bush like a fiddle."  + The author asserts that Cheney was not transformed, as Brent Scowcroft believes, but rather finally found an opportunity to exercise his own judgment about the irrelevance of Congress and the need for a unilateral Presidency autonomous from oversight and able to take bold initiatives without consultation.  [See One Percent Doctrine for a review of Cheney's mal;feasance going back to the Ford Presidency, in ursurping Presidential power].  + The author, editor in chief of Slate, observes that the press really missed this about Cheney, his intent focus on expanding Presidential power and dismissing Article 1 of the Constitution.  + The author reminds us that Cheney went from intern to Chief of Staff of the White House in 6 years, and I cannot help wondering what pathologies came from too much power too soon (see The Pathology of Power - A Challenge to Human Freedom and Safety )  + Addington receives concise but chilling coverage.  + Pages 170-171 are a priceless summary of how Cheney  -	Managed Bush's mind -	Framed choices -	Accelerated Bush's neurotic shoot from the hip uninformed decision making (while ensuring behind that Cheney's decision was preset or, if necessary, counter-manding the President behind his back after the fact, alleging to others not in a position to question, that President had changed his mind).  + The author discovered in Lynn Cheney's "Executive Privilege" (evidently no longer carried by Amazon) a telling fictional tale all too real.  + The section I found most interesting outlined the six phases of Bush Doctrine:  -	1.0  Unipolar Realism (we make reality in our own image) -	2.0 With us or Against Us -	3.0 Preemptive attack -	4.0 Democracy in the Middle East -	5.0 Freedom Everywhere -	6.0 No doctrine at all  + The author surprises me with one defense of Cheney that I consider credible: Cheney truly wanted to vaccinate the entire nation against smallpox because he truly believed the threat existed.  I am reminded of Daniel Elsberg who in Secrets: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers  recounts how he warned Henry Kissinger that reliance on Top Secret Codeword information would "make him like a moron, unable to listen to those who actually know."  + The author tells us that Bush II reads books many of them "but does not know how to think historically."  I am reminded of my youngest son, 12 years old, a brilliant wide receiver and first baseman, who at this point can read a book and not remember a thing from the plot.  + The author ends with a devastating comparison of Winston Churchill, who did outgrow Lord Randolph and make his mark, and George Junior who "in the end, ... failed to be his own man or displace his father."  Naturally there is the humiliating irony of proving that his father was right not to have gone on to Baghdad.  I just shake my head wondering how the American people have been so silent.  Here are a few other books that round out the catastrophic decrepitude of the Bush-Cheney regime:  Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency  Weapons of Mass Deception: The Uses of Propaganda in Bush's War on Iraq  Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into Insiders  Running On Empty: How The Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It  A Pretext for War : 9/11, Iraq, and the Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies  Losing America: Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency   Some time a go I wrote a piece on 9/11, "who's to blame," and it boiled down to this: We the People are to blame, for having dropped out of the democracy and abdicated our civic responsibilities.  Cheney's high crimes and misdemeanors, not least of which was letting 9/11 happen as FDR let Pearl Harbor happen, Congress abdicating its Article 1 responsibilities, the mainstream media refusing $100,000 fully paid ads against the war; a piss-ant like Wolfowitz being able to get away with questioning Shinseki's experience, insight, and honor--all of these are secondary causes and I would hasten to include the "failure of generalship," flag officer who, like Colin Powell, forgot their Oath of Office and confused loyalty with integrity.  The prime cause is that we gave our government over to what I now consider to be four organized crime families: the Clintons, the Bushes, the Democratic Party, and the Republican Party.    As McCaffrey said on CNN last night (13 Feb 08), "anyone who votes for an incumbent in 2008 should lose their American citizenship."  Tongue in cheek?  Perhaps.  Relevant and actionable?  Absolutely.  It's time to abolish this government and start over.

Granted I am nearly 9 months pregnant and have a toddler of my own but this book had me bawling.  I was so invested in the characters and what happened to each that I almost couldn't finish the book out of fear of what would happen.  Steff is your typical chick lit, flighty character and you can pretty much predict what would happen to her in the end.  Still the story was written in such a way that it will keep you engaged and hoping for a happy ending for all of the main characters.  Callie's husband at first had me guessing if he was going to go the route of the busy working husband who would turn out to be a cheater or a loving husband that would be there no matter what.  The other nice thing about this book was each chapter opens up with a recipe.  Some of them sounded so tasty I may just have to try them out myself.  Really there wasn't anything I actively disliked about this story.  The only slightly negative thing I can say is much of the story is predictable but I find that true of all chick lit books.  This is definitely a must read book but have a few tissues on hand.

He's someone who knows himself and has the courage and a burning need to speak his mind.  He also loves his family to distraction.  Justin's dad is Jewish and his mom a quiet, loving Catholic and though their child rearing approaches seem as different as their religions they make a good parenting team.    Here are a few quotes which are NOT the funniest in the book but one's that are relatively lacking in four letter words:  On Getting an Internship at Quentin Tarantino's Production Company:  "That is one ugly son of a `gun'.....Oh, yeah, no congratulations.  If you see him, try not to stare at his face if you've eaten anything."  After Justin moves out"  "You just barge in and take whatever you want, whenever you want it.  It's like you're the ********* SS I'm living in ******* Nazi Germany...."  At the End of the Day, at Least You a Have a Family:  "So, there you go.  Your mother thinks you're handsome.  This should be an exciting day for you."  On a hypothesized life of crime:  "You always got us.  We're family.  We ain't going anywhere.  Unless you go on a ******* killing spree or something."  "I would still love you Justy.  I would just want to know why you did it," my mom said earnestly.  All these quotes can seem a bit over the top when you read them out of context but they never come across as glib or hate filled.....just honest.  Justin was the youngest of three sons and the last chapter of the book is the story of one of Justin's love affairs gone awry and his dad comforting by telling the story of his first wife's life and death.  The best thing about this book, besides the humor of course, is the emotional honestly.

First of all, the Altimeter, Barometer, and Compass are amongst the favorite of my features.  The Barometer can be extremely accurate, along with the compass. Sometimes the Altimeter can be off measurement, but you can adjust that.  I've been wearing this watch for several days now and I plan to never take it off.  It just has features that blow every other watch I have in my collection away.  I always use the stopwatch and countdown timers on any digital that I have and this one adds ABC features on top of those as well; world time, atomic time keeping, and solar power, and 100 meter water resistance are all just pluses in an already feature laden time piece.  Not to mention the sunrise and sunset time's feature, which is really useful for maximizing the use of one day.  All in All, I give this watch five stars from a dramatic improvement on Casio's part from the PAW-1300.  Update 6/22/10 *.*.*.*:  As per other reviews, after owning the watch for a couple of months, I agree that the rubber strap is very uncomfortable.  Not so much the strap itself, but the little rubber wings do tend to pull wrist hair.  This watch however, does accept one piece nylon straps (22mm is correct measurement) without strap adapters; just rip off the old rubber strap and wings and replace.  I myself have changed the strap to an old 21mm nylon strap laying around in my drawer and the watch is way more comfortable.  All in all, a very accurate timepiece; with a simple swap of the band, the watch has become more comfortable to wear.

The NB305 was specifically designed to address these concerns - different battery placement and two speakers instead of just the one on the 205.    As for things this shares with the 205:  The chiklet keyboard just rocks - space between the keys goes a long way towards cutting down on the mistypes that you get on the keyboards where the keys are merging one into the next.  It may not matter to many people but if you have a long haired cat or dog that sheds and likes to spend time in your lap the fact that this is a much easier keyboard to keep pet hair out of is a huge plus as well.  Having two separate mouse buttons instead of one rocker bar is handy for those of us who like to actually use the right click.  Keyboard layout as a whole is very "touch type" friendly so those who actually learned how to type on a real keyboard or -gasp- typewriter can actually use this keyboard.  Portability is also another huge plus, when it's closed this little guy doesn't have much more of a footprint than a decent sized hard cover book and while I realize that this just means it's a netbook as somebody who still remembers his high school computer lab having IBM PS-2's it's still amazing.  In an effort to make this a true review I'll also hit a few of the things that are shortcomings for the NB305.  Is this going to let you watch high def movies - no.  Is this going to let you play World of Warcraft or other graphic intensive games - no.  Are you going to be able to multi-task 5 different RAM intensive applications - be serious you only have 1G of RAM or 2G if you upgrade.    The reason I'm giving such a great rating to this netbook is that having said all of the things that the NB305 - and for that matter netbooks in general - can't do the simple fact is that I don't want to do and wouldn't expect to do those things on a 10.1 in screen to begin with.  If you want to play games there are laptops targeted for that market, if you want to watch HD video get a laptop with a blue-ray not something that doesn't even have an optical media drive.  You can get a laptop that plays games - full discloser I have one, handles HD video and/or serves as near "desk top replacements" and you can get them for not a lot more than you will spend to get the NB305, what you will not get is the portability.  Personally I want something to check my email, check headlines on the web, watch the occasional You-Tube, do word processing, handle I-Tunes and allow me to use a Citrix client to access the work related apps on a server when I'm away from the office and still fit in my briefcase.  This little guy fits the bill and looks good doing it - thanks Toshiba.

Hearing SOS (Rescue Me) is a relief because goes beyond Pon De Replay and give Riha chance to explore on a more underground beat area. The albun which intented give Rihanna a break from reggea and dancehall (which aren't missing but few songs are still influenced by) and give her a step up to R&B area.   Dem Haters and Sean Paul's duo Break It Off prooved to be hit singles when I heard them, good dance beat zone. Rihanna never miss on that but she's got working on do on songs like Crazy Little Thing or Kisses or tittle track which take the album on the ewww zone! Really she could do much better.  R&B area was overwhelming on Unfaithful and PS (Still Not Over You) which are singles prototypes and remixes of If It's and Pon give the album a complement.   Like Music Of The Sun the album tries to get every single rythim available since reggea to R&B to underground dace beat but still have to see that Rihanna is an expert on dance tracks and very cool ballad girl. She must keep on that. Next album she'll do some hard rock if she keeps 'exploring' as record company sais.

We have had the original DS, DS Lites, DSi's, and now the DSi XL. I got an XL for myself. My son has many GBA games so he doesn't want one (because the DSi XL cannot play any GBA - Gameboy Advance- games) and my daughter thought it was too big to be portable. She likes something that fits easily into a backpack or jacket pocket. Although I think the XL could I'd probably agree if you are going for portability then the regular DSi should do you just fine. The reason I chose the XL is because I play primarily at home and I play a lot of puzzle games. Someimes these types of games are hard to see, especially the seek and find. I'm hoping this larger sized one helps that.   Even though I knew it was larger it is LARGER than I thought. That's a good thing because it is almost more like a PDA or something as far as size. Nice and substantial. It is also heavier than I anticipated. This is the only thing I'm a little concerned with as I like to play laying in bed at night and sometimes I'll play for a couple of hours. I would not want my hand getting extra tired holding the unit up. Additionally it is not as easy to hold this one handed and put the stylus in the other. It might be a fine line but it doesn't quite feel as comfortable as the DSi in that regard. It feels similar to how the PSP would feel if you held it one handed. Slightly off balance. Edited to Add: Played for 2 hours last night. Although it took a while I did find a comfortable position to hold the XL. It is not as comfortable for extended periods as the regular DSi but it did not get too heavy and my arms did not get sore. I'm quite relieved!  The top part actually has an audible click when you open up the unit. The DSi did not have this click although one of our DS Lite units did. The regular DSi opened smoothly without any catches--this one does not. There is definitely a click. The hinge looks strong enough. We lost one DS Lite to the hinge crack issue so I'm glad to see these hinges look sturdy. The other thing regarding the hinges is that the top piece moves a little when you move the unit. It is not super floppy but it does move when the unit does. I tested it against the DSi and the DS Lite and it took more effort to make those cover or top pieces move. It may be the weight itself which causes this. I will be keeping an eye on my hinges though just to be sure.   It connected right up to my internet with no problems. I went into the DSi shop and I didn't notice any difference between the XL and my regular DSi. Flawless. I must say, though, that I HATE that I could not take my DSi games with me to this upgrade (Nintendo is so far behind the ball on this and it is one of few complaints I have of Nintendo). Lame Nintendo. Seriously lame!  I got the bronze. It has a nearly black top and the inside is black. The bronze is only on the bottom and sides and it is definitely bronze. From the pictures online it looks more chocolate brown but it is not. I wavered back and forth with this and burgundy. I have not seen the burgundy out of the box but suspect it looks gorgeous. The glossy top looks like an overcoat similar to what is put on cars and trucks. Not like how the DS Lite covers were (although in two tone color this one is nearly exactly the same as the DS Lite Crimson or Blue with the colors in the same places and black in the same places except for the top because this one has the bronze color around the edges and the DS Lite's had the crimson or blue).  It does not feel "matte" on the bottom.It has a slightly grainy feel--not sure how to describe it. Kind of like how the non shiny cover of my printer feels. I remember when I got the DSi it almost seemed grainy and powdery. Not so with the XL.    Overall I'm very happy with the color-its classy!  Screen: This was my big worry. So far those worries are fairly groundless. I've tested out several types of games and in most apsects it is absolutely as good as the regular DSi. For the most part I get no pixelation or stretching and I definitely haven't noticed any ghosting or lines. While I was playing Bejeweled Twist I did notice that the gems were not as crisp as they are on the regular DSi. For me it was noticable but not bothersome. They were not blurry just a little more fuzzy than normal.    Edited to Add: I've tried several additional games and haven't noticed any issues except on games like Lunar Knights which already had a more pixelated look even on my DS Lite and regular DSi. Just slightly more noticable here but again not enough to impact. If I wasn't such a video game addict I likely wouldn't notice but I play every day.   My original DSi had several problems (Nintendo sent me a replacement)-this one has none of them. The battery cover does not "cave" in like my DSi and the insert window around the touch screen is solid--no light shows through. This XL feels as if it is a much higher quality console.   I've played with the regular stylus and the bigger pen type stylus. Either is fine but I prefer the regular stylus. The pen stylus might be good for someone who likes to hold the stylus like a pen but it is not a make or break for me.   The other functions (camera and the settings) worked well. No problems encountered. The charger looks to be the same as the regular DSi and this unit fits fine in my G Pak organizer. Edited to Add: Sound--it is actually slightly better sounding than the regular DSi. It feels as if it almost has a deeper sound. More like surround type sound. Also if you have a regular DSi there is a point when you are adjusting sound where it goes from quieter to regular and almost seems like it skips a step. The XL does not do this -- the sound progression is very good. I put in my Dragon Quest V as the music is very majestic and it felt more like it was enveloping me in the sound than a regular DSi (tested it with my daughters).  Overall I'm very happy and will update with the weight issue if it becomes a problem. Other than that I'm excited to go play my games and see them on the big screen!

Sure, many people claim to already know all they need to about Mrs. Clinton, but reading this book you really start to understand her. And whether you love her or hate her, your opinion just might be changed.  An amazingly interesting book, "A Woman in Charge" is divided into three sections. The first 70 pages cover Clinton's childhood in Chicago and college years. The next 100 recount her years in Arkansas. The remaining 350 focus on Hillary's experience as First Lady, with just a few devoted to her time as a senator.  From a young child's love of earning Girl Scout merit badges, to a 14-year-old Goldwater Girl's trip to see Martin Luther King, to a modern senator's remarkably unique reason for voting for authorized force against Iraq (she said it would make "war less likely"), there's never a dull moment. And thanks to interviews with more than 200 Clinton associates and more than 500 footnotes, every sentence rings true.  The book doesn't offer any juicy gossip, but does have lots of intimate behind-the-scenes detail. Hillary's first college boyfriend supplies Bernstein with the letters she wrote to him (what a jerk!), in which the 18-year-old freshman describes herself as "a progressive, an ethical Christian and a political activist" who is nevertheless "outrageous... as outrageous as a moral Methodist can get." Later on, Bernstein reveals that Bill Clinton asked Hillary to marry him many times before she finally said yes, and that once in Arkansas he told her he had fallen in love with another woman and wanted a divorce, which she refused. Toward the end of the book, the author recounts a moment during the peak of the Lewinsky crisis, when Stevie Wonder met Hillary at a White House dinner and insisted on taking her to a private room to perform a song he had written for her -- about forgiveness.   What impressed me most about "A Woman in Charge" is how well it is written. Though every chapter is meticulously well documented, each explains its often-complex story in a clear and engaging style. You can picture yourself in the Yale dorm room when, in 1968, the politically active junior hears of Martin Luther King's assassination and pounds the wall, screaming "I can't stand it anymore! I can't take it!" And you can't help but cringe when you read of Hillary's first meeting with Virginia Cassidy Blythe Clinton Dwire -- Bill's mom -- after the charismatic woman with the "white-striped hair and fondness for fast men, fast horses, red lipstick and false eyelashes" had driven up to New Haven from Arkansas in 1972: "Virginia thought Hillary was a fright," Bernstein writes, "her hair badly cut (she had chopped it herself that semester, to save money), no makeup, and jeans, her preferred posture tending toward a hippie slouch."  Equally compelling are the White House chapters, as Bernstein explains how Hillary's own overzealous promotion of her 1993 health-care plan ironically caused it to fail, but how her similar devotion to defending Bill against impeachment charges caused that fight to succeed.  "A Woman in Charge" includes eight pages of black-and-white photos, mostly from Clinton's years as First Lady. Under the book jacket is a plain gray cover.   All in all, what emerges is a sympathetic portrait of an extremely bright and talented American woman who has overcome a lot to get where she is -- but can nevertheless be cold, calculating and, worst of all, sometimes completely clueless on how to get things done. Bernstein shows how Hillary has learned from many of her mistakes and excelled in the Senate, but in the process has formed such a "protective shell" around her true character that she may, or may not, have what it takes to win the nomination, get elected, and be a great President.

I was a little letdown by his second -- The Understudy, which was fun, but not quite as good as his first. This book exceeds his first. He takes a great device -- following the lives of one couple on the same day over a period of 20 years -- and does a masterful job of storytelling with it. We go from the couple's idealistic college days -- they meet on the day of their graduation -- all the way into their late 30s, with all the physical and emotional changes that come during that timespan. We see the career missteps along the way, and all the various relationships they have while still remaining friends -- and the woman, Emma, always secretly in love with Dexter Mayhew, who has more than a few wild oats to sow before he realizes the woman he should be with is the one who's always been his best friend. The writing is absolutely marvelous. The dialogue is absolutely terrific -- the couple have a teasing/kneedling way of talking to each other and the reparteee between them remains funny and fresh throughout even though the novel is long -- 435 pages.  To say much more would be to give too much away. But if you like insightful books about relationships that can touch all of your emotions, this is the book for you. I think structurally the way Nicholls manages to take you on an extraordinary trip from the first page to the very last is a tour de force.  I had to buy this from amazon/uk because it was available in Britain a year before it became available in the United States, but I'm so happy I got it. This is definitely a book I will re-read several times -- and I hope Nicholls continues to have a prolific career.

I know that there has been some criticism of this drive for not having a cap or it's clean design. Neither of these points bother me and they certainly do not impact the performance of the drive. Put simply, if you're reading customer reviews because you want to know how well the drive performs, keep reading. If you're more concerned about a "pretty" drive, this isn't the review for you.  So far the drive has lived up to its selling points. I have three machines on Windows 7, one on Vista Premium and a netbook on Windows XP. I didn't have any problems using the drive with any of my machines. I am an avid photographer and I used several large photo files as well as some home videos to test this drive. File transfers to and from the drive were as fast as I've seen with other flash drives costing more. It really is a speedy little drive. This is also a good drive for ReadyBoost.  I've only had this drive for a couple of days and cannot make any claims as to long term reliability just yet but I've had good luck with other Toshiba products.

I told my husband his birthday present might be a day or two late and it arrived the day before his birthday.  Setting up the system was easy and quick for him, and he was happy that the hdmi cable was included. He doesn't always trust me to order games or game systems for him. The game included wasn't to his tastes, but honestly? I don't recall a single time we ever got a bundle that included a game he was interested in. What made this bundle a winner for me was that it IS a game my teenage daughter was interested in. She's been having a blast with it. I told him what I was getting him for his birthday so if he wanted any particular game he could get it for himself. I also did order Final Fantasy XIII when it came up as a Gold Box deal recently.  He put on a movie to see the quality of movie playback on the machine and we were all very happy with that.  As a non-gamer looking for a good present for a husband who does like console games and for something my teens would like, this is a good deal. Everyone is very happy with it for movie playback, my daughter loves Little Big Planet and visually as a crafter, I love the look of Little Big Planet. Lots of great inspiration in the colors and shapes in the game. As far as stars go, I asked my husband and daughter. He rated the bundle as very good for the system and hdmi cable. When I asked my daughter about the game, she said it was one of her favorites that she ever played. "It's very fun!"

The instructions are easy to follow and the components are easy to assemble and use -- I had my first batch (of 'Cowboy Lager') sitting in the keg after about 45 minutes of reading and work in the kitchen.  The minimum amount of time the mix needs to sit in the keg is 7 days -- I let this first batch sit for 11. The longer the time in the keg, the more flavor it's supposed to develop. I bottled the mix -- 8 liters in all -- and that was another simple process, going exactly as described in the instructions. The beer has to ferment in the bottles for no fewer than 7 days in order to carbonate. My 8 bottles are still sitting, after 8 days. I plan on letting them sit for another week before putting them in the fridge so they'll be 'conditioned' in time for Christmas.  I did, however, make an extra bottle from the first batch, in an extra bottle I had. I drained the keg almost dry to do it, even pouring in some of the sludge that had settled at the bottom. The stuff was orange and cloudy! I let that sit for the minimum 7 days, and let it condition in the fridge for only 1 (although the instructions recommend at least a week). I wanted to try something close to the minimum standard for the mix and the kit in general...and I have a mug of the stuff next to me as I type. Final verdict on this 'minimum mix' -- it's quite good! It was adequately carbonated, and produced a smooth head that had a nice smell and flavor. The beer itself is about the same color as a typical American brew -- Coors or Michelob -- and has a very light flavor, with a slightly dry aftertaste. It's something I could enjoy in the middle of summer. And remember: this, according to the instructions, is the swill. The better stuff will come out of those bottles that are going to ferment for another week before I cool them.  I'm fired up! I made my next mix today -- American Blonde -- which was also included in the set. I'll let that sit in the keg even longer to see how the flavor develops. All in all, I'm really happy with this as a present, and even happier about what's it's produced. This isn't just a gift that seems cool: it's already exceeded my expectations.  This section added on 8 June 2009: I'm now carbonating my 17th two-gallon batch. Yes, that's a lot of beer, considering that each batch makes 20-24 bottles, depending on how much water I decide to add (sometimes a little more if it's a heavy brew with a lot of ingredients). ANYWAY, I'm still as fired up about this thing as I was when I got it. We've bought two six-packs and one twelve-pack of beer from the store since December, and that was mostly to harvest bottles for future use. I do not miss buying beer at the store...mine is better, and cheaper, too. My only recommendation is to get 12-oz brown glass bottles, a hand-held capper, and O2 barrier caps -- then you can bottle your own 'normal' bottles, and you can reuse them. The 1-liter PET bottles that came with my set are fine, as they keep the carbonation well, but I don't like opening that much beer at once unless I have people over. Standard bottles are far more convenient. Mr. Beer rocks. That is all.

Lieutenant Colonel Robert &quot;Buzz&quot; Patterson penned &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; after his retirement because he would never have been able to publish this kind of information while working for the government. &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; is a gripping, yet horrifying read that'll have you realizing how lucky the U.S. was during the eight year Clinton/Gore Administration. One of the most damning charges is that Clinton once lost the &quot;nuclear football,&quot; the suitcase that carries this country's nuclear launch codes. Clinton's response, according to Patterson, was a cavalier, &quot;I'll track'em down guys.&quot; You'll also read about the time in 1998 that Clinton blew off his National Security Advisor so he could finish a round of golf, while stealth-bombers, engines running, their pilots in the cockpits, sat on a Mid-East tarmac  until the cover of darkness was lost and a vital mission against Saddam Hussein was called off. Patterson also gives an entirely new look at the &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; story, with Clinton denying the troops the weaponry they requested, then sending them into harm's way and ultimately blaming the disaster on his Secretary of Defense. &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; is a searing indictment of the Clinton administration from an insider's view. This book deserves to be read by every American!

The Lovely Bones isn't that kind of movie.  Director Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings and King Kong fame, doesn't seem like the most obvious choice to direct the adaptation of the seemingly untouchable Alice Sebold novel, but he does his best, by staying close to the source material, but occasionally taking things out here and there. He also brings alot of ah-mazing CGI shots that are so gorgeous, they may be worth the price of admission alone, and I doubt we would've had that type of a movie if anybody else had directed it. However, you get the feeling that Jackson paid too much attention to the CGI aspect, while he could've dealt with the center plot issue with more directorial sensitivity, mocking the same way the book was written, and that's what stops this from being a perfect movie.  The plot centers around Susie Salmon (played by Saoirse Ronan), a 14-year-old girl who is raped and murdered in 1973. Ronan was absolutely perfect in this role. She showed promise in the 2007 film Atonement, where she also played a terrified youth who is dealing with an unbelievable situation. In the film, Susie is watching over her family, the boy she was in love with, and her killer -- from her own personal heaven.  Stanley Tucci nails his role, playing the demented serial killer Mr. Harvey. He gives a particularly chilling, and uncannily believable performance, showing more versatility with every film he makes, you can tell that he really got lost in this role, because his part isn't one of those where you find yourself wondering what the actor has previously starred in -- you see his character, and he does a damn fine job at it.  Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon play Susie's family, and each of those roles require the actor to display quite alot of emotion, grieving her loss, and they all do terrific work, causing you to feel the extreme remorse that their characters do, and I really don't know if better actors could have been selected to play the respective parts.  Nikki SooHoo plays Holly, a girl who Susie meets in heaven, another victim of Mr. Harvey. Her role is particularly memorable, serving as something of a reassuring voice to the Ronan's character, and I see her doing great things in her future, because, while being an unknown actress, she shows just as much talent as the other actors in this all-star cast.  The core of this movie, however, the reason to go and see it in a packed theatre, doesn't lie in its acting, or the writing, or even the direction. It lies in the story. We've all wondered what happens to us after we die. The Lovely Bones suggests that we go to a world that we think is perfect, but we're still haunted by the things that troubled us in our lives. And while the movie leaves you heartbroken, wanting to spend every day you have on this earth as your last, it leaves you pondering your own life, the significance of it, how you'll be remembered. And that's something I particularly like in a film, when it not only moves you to the point where tears are flooding your eyes, but when it leaves you with a great deal of psychological issues to ponder, about your own life, and what comes after your life is ultimately over. And that's what The Lovely Bones does. And while staying true to the source material, that's all a fan of this story can ask for.

But believe me, there's a whole lot more information in this book that little tidbits like that (hehe).  That "slim-fast" drink diet has nothing on a live juice fast!  If you wanna do things right, get this book and do it right! Your liver is the hardest working organ in the body and with our typical American lifestyle it is under enormous strain.  It will blow your mind to discover just how much toxin the liver works to eliminate from the body and how critical the liver is to your quality of life and protecting against and fighting disease.  Your liver does about 500 or more different processes, many of them at the same time.  It works constantly, without rest to keep you alive and well. Toxic Relief will make you want to eat right and make you afraid not to.  You'll want to be a lot nicer to your liver after reading this book.  The book takes you step by step through a process of liver detoxification (2 week program) and juice fasting (which follows the liver detox - actually the 2 week program is to jump start your liver so that you will gain the most effective results from the juice fast and eliminate, safely and effectively, the most toxins from your system as well reap the most healthful benefits of the juice). Not only does Dr. Colbert tell you how to go about juice fasting, he tells you what kind of juicer you need, where to buy it and even how much to expect to spend.  He lists the important vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs and other nutrients and foods that are most beneficial to liver detox and restoring health to the GI tract (your intestines and digestive system) and he tells you how much of each to take, when to take it, and how.  He also lists and explains the foods that are harmful to your liver.  The book also includes juicing recepies for each day during the fast (morning, mid-morning, afternoon and evening).  There are six recipie veriations for six different types of drinks for each time of the day or you could apply a different drink for each day of the fast.  The recepies are fantastic and enormously simple, but it's also fun to totally create your own concoctions.  Dr. Colbert tells you what juices are most important, even for your particular blood type, and tells you specifically what juice should make up the bulk of each drink. Dr. Colbert spends the majority of the book discussing the health benefits and healing qualities of juice fasting and liver detox, but also explains the spiritual benefits of fasting and gives some practical tips about how to approach a spiritual fast. This was an excellent book!  Not boring in the least and gives you real information that you can put to use right away.  He's not trying to sell the reader on some product or multi-level marketing scheme.  This is just good information on how to jump-start your immune system, increase energy, fight disease, look and feel great!  Every person in America should read this book and follow its prescribed program.  I bought a juicer right after reading it and am on the program now!  WOW!!!  That's all I can say.  You're gonna feel amazing and you're gonna get a ton of those poisoness toxins cleaned out of your system!  Get this book!  You will not be disappointed, I promise!

Rectangular shape is perfect for smaller spaces -- same square footage as square play yards, but the rectangle shape fits easily into more places (like bringing it into the dining room when the sit-down dinner went on too long for a one-year old; the square play yard would not have fit). I'm an urban grandma and did not want anything with primary colors. The navy looks very nice with my decor. I was worried about the lower price, thinking the play yard would be inferior.  Don't worry.  It's not.  Happily, this is not a case of "you get what you pay for."  I'm very pleased with this play yard, my granddaughter is happy in it.  Great play yard.

So let me first say things that I do like about the phone. Of course the greatest improvement was the addition of the trackpad, at first it was kind of unusual to navigate with it but I got accustomed to it very quickly. Second thing is the screen resolution, it was improved from the old bold by 480x360 vs 480x320 pixels. The screen is really crisp and bright and sunlight legibility is very decent. The camera also experienced an improvement and while I was taking pictures outside on a bright day and later comparing them to the previous bold, there is a very noticeable change, pictures look somewhat close to my wife's 10 megapixel canon camera. I was also surprised by the improved quality of the videos this device shoots. Much better and less pixelated  than the original bold! Now for the things that I don't like or wished to be improved. Despite of the fact that everyone raves about "amazing" battery life on this device, I must say I am disappointed. At best, the battery lasts me a day and a half but not two day as many reviewers say. Perhaps I do extensive web browsing and chatting via instant messaging. I usually like to read various blogs and news on opera mini 5 browser and I noticed that this application along with IM+ drains battery like crazy! Of course at least now I don't have to carry a spare battery with me like it was with the previous bold since I am sure this one will last me for the full day.  But most often I still have to charge it every night. Which is kind of a disappointment and not what I expected after reading various reviews. Now about the browser: It sucks.... It simply sucks so much that any other smartphone's browser will put it to shame. But another annoying problem now that I noticed is that I can't get to mobile version of citibank online at all! No matter how I would reconfigure the browser... So it means no banking online for me as I used to do on my previous bold. Very annoying... The browser is still slow as hell  and only the fact that I have opera on this phone doesn't make it a deal breaker. I must say though that I am running a latest .405 version of the software and perhaps the issue with banking online maybe be fixed in later versions. Which I again, doubt very much. Now another disappointment is the absence of many  supported languages. For example there is no Russian support whatsoever. But than again, it may be released in the later versions. I hope so. And now last but not least is the speaker quality. In the first day of use I noticed that the speaker has been  downgraded. Instead of the three speakers which previous bold had, this device has only one and when you bring the volume all the way up you can hear a rattling noise. Not a very nice experience... Overall I like the device especially it's size, I was skeptical about it as I liked the bold 9000 big screen. But this one seems to be slim and looks more eye appealing.  also I like the battery cover design, you can not accidentally open it and whole device seems sturdy and has a look of a professional tool. Hopefully with next updates there will be support for more languages. But as of now I am giving it only 3 stars.  UPDATE:  Couple of weeks ago I noticed that phone would randomly delete data, but today was the worst: In the morning I discovered that all my contacts were completely wiped out!!! by itself! And when I tried to restore them from the backup file it would not do that saying that the file is read only. I tried this file in my old curve 8310 and it worked flawlessly. So I suspect that there are serious bugs in the OS 5.0 and AT&T is not coming up with any updates as of yet. In a mean time I am lowering score for this phone because i am very disappointed by the poor implementation  UPDATE 2:  As five months passed since I got this phone, I must admit I like it much more than I did before. True, I still have some issues with it, but these issues are just too minor comparing to lots of useful features that this device delivers. Previously I wrote that it deleted all my contacts from the phone book,  and last week it just happened again but I noticed that it happened after I added an another gmail account to the phone. So after I gooogled a bit I found out that gmail actually will sync your contacts with your gmail account but for some unknown reason remove them from the phone book. So basically all you have to do is to download google sync on your phone and transfer contacts back to the phone book. So I tend to believe that this issue has more to do with google gmail setup rather than the phone itself. Also the issue with the Citibank mobile site have resolved mysteriously, and now I am able to do banking through the native browser (which still sucks by the way in many aspects) I am also looking forward to the release of OS 6.0  which should include webkit browser with flash support and other new and exciting features. So I must say that ever since I got this phone it never crashed or restarted on me, not even a single time. So I must increase the rating of the phone to 4 stars as it's been a really great tool which I certainly can rely on in terms of usability and trust.

Every time I would need to fix an XP machine it wasn't because of something wrong with the OS itself, but because the machine had virus/spyware/trojans etc. Enter Vista. MS fixed most of the security problems but did so at the expense of performance and stability. Now with Windows 7 you get the best of both worlds. XP was released in 2001 and hardware has come a long way since then, but the OS itself remained relatively static and could only take advantage of newer hardware at a basic level. Vista was an improvement and Windows 7 handles it better still.   I think Vista, although I had few problems with it, will go down as ME 2.0. At the same time Windows 7 will be XP 2.0. People will cling to it and MS will have to kill it off before people will move on to it's next offering, whatever that may be.   With that said I would highly recommend that both XP and Vista users upgrade. Unlike previous upgrades you will actually get better performance and use less resources post-upgrade. A first for MS. Security is rock solid. If XP is swiss cheese, then Win 7 is the wall of China. You no longer have to download the "patch of the day" from Windows Update. I haven't played around with Media Player, but Media Center is great for watching DVDs and remains pretty much unchanged from Vista. My favorite features are Jump Lists, AERO Snap (for working in two windows side by side). Networking is a bit easier (especially compared to XP). Performance is much improved from Vista and is comparable to or even faster than XP. Calculator, Paint, and Wordpad have been updated. If you are upgrading from Vista you do lose a couple of progams, namely Windows Mail and Photo Gallery. Updated versions can be downloaded from Windows Update for free. The only downside is that upgrading from XP requires a clean install.   As far as the upgrade process itself goes, it's painless. Just be sure to run the upgrade advisor before you do. All that's required of you is a product key (at the end of the installation) and activation. So all you have to do is pop the disc in, grab a good book, and before you know it you're in computing heaven.

The Fantastic Mr. Fox, which of course I read long ago, is a most stunning and hilarious treat that I know we will watch again and again.  The reviews here are splendid, so I will hone in on some points:  1. Desplat has done it again with a soundtrack that kicks just right...yet he doesn't interfere with the terrific songs such as selections from Brian Wilson's "Heroes and Villains".  2. The vocal talent here is unmatched in animated experience. George Clooney pitted against Sir Michael Gambon? Bill Murray sparring with Jason Schwartzman and Wes Anderson (who voiced as well as directed)...superb! Even the inimitable Brian Cox makes an absolutely side-splitting cameo.  3. I haven't seen gripping stop-motion animation like this since the last time I saw a Russian animated film...and that was LOOOOONG ago. This is such a must-see for all children.  4. Saying which, I think the substitution of the word "cuss" where all cuss words would normally be used is one of the most brilliant things I've ever heard.  5. In case anyone misses the point, Roald Dahl, who was decades ahead of his time, meant this story to be a basic morality play about mankind's greed and seeming hatred toward animals. Yet the film also shows in the most humorous way the nature of wild animals as well. Who do you think is and ought to be the victor in this?  6. Keep eyes and ears peeled for various homages and references that the kids might miss.  Marvelous, and I only wish I had more stars to award it! OSCAR time for Best Animated Film feature-length!

I didn't want to downsize from a 12X zoom to a 3X, so I just continued using it till something else caught my attention. Enter the Z1485. An AWESOME little camera.  I received the camera in mid-December. I used the battery that came with it, a non-rechargeable KLIC-8000 Li-Ion. It lasted about a month, all through Christmas (during which I took MANY pictures) and regular daily pics (I have an 11 month old, so I take a lot!). I just changed the battery a few days ago to a rechargeable KLIC-8000 Li-Ion. If you purchase this camera, MAKE SURE you buy the correct battery for it. Of course it's going to suck up regular AA batteries, it's a powerful little point and shoot.  The picture clarity is fantastic (keep in mind, I'm just a casual picture taker. Day-to-day pics of my son, and family trips). All the pics I've downloaded to my Kodak program and printed out have come out beautifully. I normally use the smart-scene, but sometimes (like during Christmas) I use other settings, like the candle light setting for pics of the Christmas tree. They came out perfect, all nice and soft. The size of the camera itself is perfect...I actually bought an ipod jogging case for it so I can wear it around my wrist or arm during vacations (nice to always have the camera handy), and it fit just fine.   I've always used Kodak for their simple no-brainer approach to picture taking, and this camera fits that to a tee. I'm so glad I upgraded. I'll always love my Z712, but this little guy has everything I need. PLEASE do not be dissuaded by the mediocre reviews here. Most people know NOT to put regular AA batteries in a digital camera. It sucks the life out of them in no time. With the proper batteries, this camera is light, clear, and does an all around GREAT job!

Consequently, Edward is filled with guilt and decides that she needs to lead a normal life without being endangered by their presence every day, and so they all pack up and leave. I nearly choked when I saw that time passes without him.  But, try as she might, Bella is empty without him. She realizes that when she is in danger, she can hear his voice in her head (usually yelling), and so she begins to pursue dangerous hobbies just to hear his voice again. One of these hobbies brings her into close friendship with Jacob Black, the Quileute Indian boy who tipped her off to Edward's identity in the first book, and he seems to temporarily appease her pain at Edward's absence. But Jacob has his own secrets, and Bella is again endangered when a vampire returns to Forks for revenge.  I must admit, most of the reason this book kept me up late reading was in hopes of word from Edward. Jacob and his friends were fun, and it *was* exciting to see another facet of the books' mythology, but almost the whole time Bella was with Jake, I was adamantly pining for Edward. When he does return, I was not disappointed, and Jake's involvement also sets up the potential for a powerful love triangle.  It wasn't quite as solid as the first book, but I sense that New Moon is an important transition. Many questions were brought up, like whether vampires have souls, and just how far must Bella and Edward go to stay together? She wants to become one of them, and Edward insists that she remain human. Now that we've caught wind of it, what exactly is agreed in the treaty the vampires have with the Quileutes? And what will Bella do now that her boyfriend and her best friend are mortal enemies? All of this feels like necessary groundwork in order to address these issues in the next book. I enjoyed New Moon immensely, despite Edward's absence for most of it, and I'm eager for the next installment; I can't wait to see how Meyer resolves some of these issues, and what ride we will experience in the next book.
like	0	To properly evaluate the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor, I decided to compare it to the new Schick Hydro 5 and my normal razor, a Schick Quattro Power. All started with a new cartridge and a fresh battery as applicable.  I'll begin by saying that I've been using Schick razors for about 40 years and have not been too impressed by most Gillette razors. In particular, they tended to clog up more and were harder to keep clean. I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the ProGlide as well.  ProGlide vs. Hydro 5 Initial impressions:  Packaging: Both come in the standard plastic clamshell, but the Gillette is easier to open. The back is perforated for easy opening, where the Schick is more child-proof and requires a sharp object to open it.  What's included: The Gillette comes with only one cartridge, where the Hydro comes with two.  Holders: the Gillette snaps snugly in to the included plastic holder, while the Schick holder just has a small pin to locate the razor. You could use the Gillette's as a travel holder with no problem.  Guarantee: The Schick comes with a money back guarantee. The Gillette assumes you will like it.  The razors: While the Gillette looks more substantial, both weigh 1.4 oz fully loaded.  The Gillette has a single blade trimmer on the back  of the cartridge. Flip the razor 180 deg to use it. The Hydro's trimmer is under the lube strip that you flip back to use the trimmer.  Cartridge mounting: The ProGlide cartridge slides on easily and snaps in place. The locator pin also acts as "suspension" for the cartridge pivot. The Hydro is a bit more imprecise. You have to line up two small spring loaded fingers on the handle with tabs on the cartridge. Not hard, but not as elegant as the Gillette. The Schick cartridge is smaller than the Gillette...less waste.  On initial "hefting" the Gillette felt better, but in use both were comfortable and easy to maneuver.  The Shave Test All of the above are secondary to the "Yes, But How Does It Shave" test. I shaved half of my face with the Gillette and half with the Schick, using Proraso Shaving Cream  and a badger bristle brush.  Shave No. 1: (3 Day Growth) The ProGlide felt smooth in all directions, with and against the grain. No pulling on the neck or under the chin. The trimmer was easy to use.  The Hydro was smooth on the cheeks, but pulled noticeably on the neck, especially against the grain. It left a couple of small "razor burn" marks on my neck. To use the trimmer you have to hold the razor with one hand and flip back the cover with the other.  Both razors rinsed clean easily with no clogging.  The Wife Test: Immediately after shaving, Mrs. Boilermate judged the Gillette side marginally smoother, but said that side felt sticky. After my face "dried" she still said the Gillette side was smoother.  Shave No. 2: (2 Day Growth) The Gillette was smooth while the Hydro pulled noticeably on the neck and under the chin. The Gillette side was again judged smoother in the Wife Test.  ProGlide vs Quattro Shave Nos. 3 and 4 were done with a two and three day growth respectively using the ProGlide and a Schick Power Quattro (with a new cartridge and a fresh battery).  The first thing I noticed is the ProGlide is noticeably quieter, where the Quattro sounds like an electric razor by comparison.  In both tests, the ProGlide performed as before, with no pulling or burning. The Quattro pulled slightly on the neck, but substantially less than the Hydro did.  As before, the Gillette side was judged smoother by Mrs. B., tho by a similarly small margin.  So what's not to like? The price of the cartridges. Schick cartridges are cheaper across the board than Gillette. Power ProGlide carts are about $4.00 apiece, where Quattro Power carts are about $2.50 each.  While the ProGlide gives an excellent shave, doesn't shave enough better to justify switching from the Quattro based on the cost of the cartridges.  Overall, though, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power rates five stars. As a life-long Schick user, I was pleasantly (and unexpectantly) surprised by this razor. If you can get past the price of the cartridges, I highly recommend this razor.

My primary display is an Acer AL2002W, and wanted to match it up and decided to go with this as I could not find one or one close to it. This monitor is pretty much a internet monitor for use while working.  Pros: Great looking display. Text is tight and crips, blacks looks clean as do whites.  Cons: Thought that the info said this was a 1680*1050 display but that was a reviewer comment, not Amazon. True aspect 16:9@1600*900 60Hz  Other: For a good 2nd display, or even a Primay this is a good deal. Would have like a height adjustment, but as the AL2002W does not have this, was not expecting this one to either. For $120 I can't say anything bad about it other than what I noted under cons.
like	0	The post-apocalypse sub-genre of science fiction has always been a place I like to go.  I'll give movies of this type some slack I wouldn't always give other kinds, so that even a relatively weak post-apoc flick like Doomsday (in which Malcolm McDowell appeared, as he does here) still has its interesting moments. But if it's a good one such as I Am Legend, I'm really into it bigtime.  So I've been eagerly anticipating The Book of Eli from the time the first trailers appeared, and now that I've seen it there were many things about it I liked.  Start with the mythic prophet main character.  His super-heroic weapons skills showed there was something unique about him early on.  Those scenes were generally pretty cool, and they were spread out pretty well over the length of the film.  (Any more fight scenes would have bored me.)  Eli's story plays out with a kind of grim determinism, although it also has hopeful elements as well.  I was glad I wasn't previously familiar with the story, as the major revelations about the Book in the final act were a complete surprise.   Mr. Washington was an excellent choice for the lead.  Other roles were well cast too, including (to my surprise) Jennifer Beals as the blind mistress of Gary Oldman's bad boss character.  Oldman himself struck just the right notes of ego, madness & desperation.   Anyway, as far as the post-apoc nature of the movie, it provides fascinating glimpses of which possessions would be really valuable in such a world (ex., chapstick yes; cigarette lighter, not so much), and other aspects of survival felt very authentic throughout the film.  All in all, it wasn't quite the adventure I was expecting (with occasional pacing issues), but I still found it to be an enjoyable viewing experience.

A good review of basic facts in regards to male & female bodies, esp. for those of us who have been out of sex ed for a while now.  Also provides some thoughtful information for "beginners".    It also includes interesting extra facts & information, like sex during pregnancy, sex during menstruation, the importance of prostate & other male/female exams, interesting pros & cons of different positions, etc.  Also, Dr. Ruth's personality comes through in the book, which is generally a good thing.  She adds a touch of humor to this book, though at times a bit too quirky...    Overall, a good book for the topic and probably useful for parents wanting to speak to their kids about sex (or if they are too uneasy to give them the talk directly).

This stuff doesn't work, AND they give you one glove, not 2, for those of us with sensitive skin. It is hard to knead with just one hand.

like	0	Pete Townshend possibly feels a lot like David O. Selznick, the producer of the movie `Gone With The Wind' in fearing that he will only be remembered in his obituary by his creating that one work, as Townshend, like Selznick, seems to have been spending his time after completing their most important work in trying to top it.  To my mind, Townshend should have no regrets about not topping `Tommy', as it is easily one of the two or three most important albums and works in the entire Rock canon, similar in importance and possibly superior in quality to `Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' and `Blond on Blond', to name just two others high in the ranks of great Rock albums.  One thing which surprises me about writing on `Tommy' is how little deep analysis has been essayed about the story behind the songs. In a nutshell, the story is this:  Tommy Walker is born while his father is off on some journey (`It's a boy') from which he becomes several years late in returning. Tommy's mother takes up with a lover, father returns, mother and lover kill father with Tommy as a witness, and mother and lover tell Tommy he saw and heard nothing (`You didn't hear it'). Tommy becomes functionally blind, deaf, and dumb to all outside appearances, however, it is evident that within his own head, he can see and hear everything (`There's a doctor I've found'). He is tormented by various malicious relatives (`Cousin Kevin' and `Fiddle About') and `treated' by various attempts, including hallucinogens (`Acid Queen'). As he grows up, the only outside experience to which he responds is a pinball machine, at which he becomes expert (`Pinball Wizard'). Tommy is finally cured by watching his image in a mirror smashed by, I believe, his mother's lover (`Smash the Mirror'). Being released from his isolation for Tommy is like being released from a practically lifelong mystical experience heightened by pinball. The charisma with which Tommy is imbued by this experience leads him to become a `New Messiah' (`Sally Simpson') creating a movement which expands beyond local resources (`Welcome') and becomes institutionalized into a ritual modeled after playing pinball while deaf dumb and blind (`Tommy's holiday camp'). The story ends with a revolt of Tommy's disciples against his new religion (`We're not gonna take it').  The theme of being oppressed runs throughout practically all of Townshend's work, although in `Tommy', it takes a back seat to mysticism. The people who dote on the philosophical background of  `The Matrix' should sink their teeth into the `Tommy' story and ruminate on that a while. The major musical theme of the work seems to be Townsend's search for a magical chord. And, anyone who, like myself, has seen `Tommy' performed live by the original Who will have no trouble believing Townsend has found his chord as he hits that first great whirlwind chord in `Pinball Wizard'. Talk about a rush! In general, a lot of the music echoes earlier Who works. Townshend seems to constantly cut and paste phrasings from one work to another and I have no problem with this except in the most tedious of the three instrumental pieces (`Underture') in the album.  Some writers have said that 'Tommy' is more like an Oratorio or a Song Cycle than it is an Opera, but I disagree. Neither of these other two genres requires a plot, and an Opera does, and Tommy has a plot. I prefer to think of it as a selection of arias and instrumental passages from which some bridging dialogue has been left out. My biggest problem with this plot is that the actual event that triggers Tommy's autism is only hinted at in the most vague of terms. It is easy to believe that it was a murder, but the lyrics of `You Didn't Hear It' never come even close to saying exactly what the event was. On the other side of the coin, the great majority of the songs on the album `Tommy' directly support carrying the story forward. Practically the only exception is the Sonny Boy Williamson classic `Eyesight to the Blind'. It is probably symptomatic that only `Pinball Wizard', `I'm Free', and `Sensation' out of the 24 cuts in `Tommy' really work for the Who outside the context of the whole work. That's why I'm especially happy to have seen The Who perform virtually the whole album live, four days after it was initially released. It is also interesting to see that the two cuts describing episodes of sadism were written by Entwistle and not Townshend.  This CD contains exactly what was on my original vinyl two record album bought in 1969, suitably enhanced with modern electronics. My greatest respect for Townshend is for creating a classic musical form, the Opera, using an entirely ROCK instrument, with the slightest classical leavening from John Entwistle's French horn on a few early numbers. So many `rock' versions of traditional forms simply overlay rock performances on classical arrangements or make classical arrangements of rock melodies. Aside from `Quadrophenia', the only other work which succeeds at doing this is Spooky Tooth/Pierre Henry work `Ceremony An Electronic Mass'.  Listening to this album and every other early Who album reminds one just how much their performances were a collaborative effort between the original four, and how much we miss Keith Moon and John Entwistle today. We can only say that with `Tommy' and numerous other works and recorded performances, the memory of The Who will live forever.  Seminal work in the history of Rock.

I have this connected via HDMI to receiver, surround sound and a 52" HDTV. Due to the limitations of my setup (not the EB1501), I do not use HDMI for sound, so I will not say anything about the box's ability to carry both signals properly.  If you use S/PDIF for audio, you are going to appreciate the included adapter (works great).  I was going to use Boxee or XBMC, but I don't like the hassle of setting up and integrating Tv tuners into those, so I am using Windows 7's Media Center.  The EB1501 is EVERYTHING I have been looking for in a HTPC.  It runs (very) cool and (very) quiet.  It's barely noticeable yet attractive enough to not have to hide - which makes it easier to get to the DVD drive, power, ports, etc...   The computer is stable and a workhorse for this task.    With the Atom processor, I wouldn't recommend trying to do too much gaming or heavy multitasking.  As a component in a home theater, this thing runs circles around the almost useless Media Center Extender I was using before.

The printer is far quieter than the Photosmart 7550 I had before (it sounded like two monkies with hammers were working inside). The 8000 is very quiet to me.  I use a PC with the XP op system and it takes a total of 30 seconds to print anything I've printed so far.  It usually takes 12 to 14 seconds to initiallize and around 15 to 18 seconds to print the page - whether all text or partial graphics.  I've not had any paper handling issues either - though I do just use HP All Purpose paper.  I haven't tried unusual paper types.  Bottom line: if you just want a printer you can count on for everyday stuff then this is the one.

After all, everyone from KISS too Evanescence have admitted to using backing vocals live. But does that mean they make bad CDs?   Not at all.   Autobiography is am excellent teen-pop disk. Period. Most people will take their aggressions out on this CD since it has the name Ashlee Simpson attached to it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't contain some of the catchiest pop-rock tunes this decade.  Of course, it's not for everyone. Music snobs who like "important" tunes (i.e.: Death Cab for Cutie, Radiohead, etc.) will not like this CD. It's total fluff, but it's the kind of catchy, fun fluff you can't help but blast in your car and scream along to.   (In fact, you can practically hear groups of giggling girls at a slumber party somewhere singing along with you.)

Like other reviewers have stated, this product will dehydrate you like nothing else. It does a great job at suppressing your appetite, so when you do eat, you're more likely to "remember" to eat something healthy - as opposed to raiding the fridge when you're ravenous.   These pills have helped me lose weight (I'm not talking a ton of weight, but enough to keep me re-purchasing the product). My only complaint is this: this seller - and many sellers of this product - claim the following: "PACKAGES WITH SILVER ON BOTH SIDES ARE FAKE! The authentic capsules are are packaged with green foil on one side and silver on the other. Beware of sellers that lie to you about all silver packaging. The fake all silver packaging is not effective, so don't waste your money." See above item description.   Uh, anyway -- the item I received had silver on BOTH sides. Does that mean the seller sold me a fake product? If so, why would he/she broadcast that? Who knows. I ordered these pills before from a different seller and the packaging has ALWAYS been silver on both sides. Perhaps this seller can  either 1) remove that verbiage that says the product I purchased from his/her company is FAKE, or 2) clarify whether the packaging has changed since the above claim.

This book is wonderfully written and contains very little rehashed material which at this point is very hard to do.  The best part is the critical analysis of Hillary's past  writings and how they expose a hidden political agenda.  Olson's analysis  of the First Lady's seemingly unaltered radical persuasion is convincingly  demonstrated in this meticulously  researched biography. This type of writing  is not one star.  One star is like trying to bury the many insights  which this book magnificently exposes.  Bravo Barbara!

As you may have noticed, my movie summary for "Top Dog" was done in one whole sentence. That's because the story itself is quite simple for all audiences. It's the classic formula: good guys vs. bad guys. There are no `in-betweens' or `switching' of the good and bad so it's easy to keep track of who-is-who.  Unfortunately, though the classic formula `good vs. bad' most often works well, "Top Dog" had more `bad moviemaking' going for it than any `good moviemaking' to make this movie worth watching. Of course, it IS entertaining, but how far will one go to be `just' entertained?  Chuck Norris, never really being known for his acting abilities, seems at times to be enjoying himself but on the whole, he just lets everything flow on its own. Not once does he try to make his character his own, unique one. But that could be because the director does not really give him a chance to really do anything.  Instead, the audience is made to suffer somewhat by having to endure a bigger version of `Benji' for the hero of the film. There were mixed reviews on Amazon as to whether they liked Reno or not but in my opinion, Reno just did not impress. While, no doubt about it, we are continually made to believe that Reno is very intelligent (and sometimes he IS), there are times where he's just annoying. The ending was too contrived and moments where Reno is supposed to be cute just doesn't come out well. To sum up, everything Reno does is nothing special. If you've seen other `dog' movies like "K-19" or "Turner and Hooch", there is nothing in "Top Dog" which you haven't seen before.  The music was also badly done, especially the scene where the terrorists are trying to take out Chuck Norris at his house. The whole scene is supposed to be exciting, but the music utterly throws all suspense out. And... the terrorists are wearing clown masks?!?!   Ultimately, I believe that the main thing that went wrong with "Top Dog" is that the filmmakers couldn't quite make up their minds whether to make this a movie for children or for adults. While rated PG-13, the movie seems to be aimed for a younger audiences with having Reno the Dog as a main character. But at the same time, having terrorists and some violence would have children turning away, especially the murder of Lou Swanson. Adults however will probably be repelled from the storyline and the fact of having Reno the Dog in the story.   So, in conclusion, "Top Dog" can hardly be considered a classic so I really won't put this on my `recommend to others' list. My advice, if you still want to watch the movie, probably better to rent than actually buy it. Trust me, it's not worth it. The only thing that might interest viewers is watching Chuck Norris `do his thing', or shall we say, using his fighting skills. But definitely not top-notch stuff compared to other kung fu movies.

I have the Super Clear Double Receiver by Safety 1st in my 2 year old's room, which works perfect.  I needed a second one for my newborn.  I tried another Safety 1st, and even with 2 channels, I could only pick up sound from one room.  Then I returned it for a Sound N Lights monitor by Fisher-Price.  Bigger mistake, we couldn't hear any room, only major static.  Finally we tried this one and love it!!!  It is so quiet, except, of course, when your baby makes noise.  I can't believe how many channel options it has, and other features too, like an alarm when you are almost out of range.  Also, a rechargable battery, that charges when plugged in, so you don't have to waste your own batteries when wanting to use it outside.  Go for the Gold, this Sony is the best yet.
like	0	With this his first novel, author William Golding wrote a novel that he could never surpass in greatness. Lord of the Flies is a novel about our human nature. Too often I think, people jump to quick conclusions about the book and Golding's stand on human nature. "His stance is too pessimistic" or "That books really gross." What these people fail to realize is that Golding tried to paint a picture of human nature as he saw it. He wasn't making things up, I don't think he was particularly angry, he wrote Lord of the Flies to expose people to the atrocities that he witnessed in World War II.  One of the largest underlying principles in Lord of the Flies is of course, human nature. William Golding gives the reader three interesting characters to analyze: Jack, Piggy, and Ralph. It's quite apparent as you read the novel that Golding must have read a little Sigmund Freud before writing Lord of the Flies. Let's start with Jack. Jack is the definite Id on the island. He wants to survive but he also wants to eat meat and have fun. Jack is clearly unable to control these urges and in turn has a pretty large influence on the other boys on the island. Piggy is the definite Superego on the island. Piggy is always referring to "well my auntie..." and always finds an excuse not to do something. Piggy has no intentions of satisfying his id, and in turn influences only Ralph and Simon. Ralph on the other hand, takes the middle road. He is clearly trying to find a way to satisfy his id, but he can't seem to find one. Take what he said in chapter eight for instance: "...Without the fire we can't be rescued. I'd like to put on war-paint and be a savage. But we must keep the fire burning..." Ralph is definitely trying to satisfy his id, but those laws of culture still remain with him, telling him it's not the thing a proper English boy should do.  Another interesting connection I made while reading, was one between Jack's status of leader and the ideology of Thomas Hobbes. Unlike Hobbes though, Jack's power was used for quite the opposite affect. Hobbes believed that in order for a perfect society to exist, a higher power had to be in charge, in order to keep the other citizens in check. Jack was that higher power on the island. He was in control of everything, however, his power had quite the opposite affect of "keeping people in check." Jack used the powerful persuasion of the id to persuade others. Jack could promise meat and fun, whereas Ralph could promise labor and fruit, something the other boys definitely didn't want.  Lord of the Flies is also a novel filled with symbolism. Probably the most important of these symbols was the conch. The conchs represented several things, including freedom and order on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, unity between the boys. One of the most interesting aspects to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn't use it. This shows a lack of leadership or strength on Piggy's part. The conch became a tool of free speech. Those who wanted to speak at the tribal council had to hold the conch in order to be heard. However, as the story progressed, this practice diminished more and more, until the island was a place of complete chaos and anarchy. In one of the last chapters of the novel, the conch gets completely destroyed. This symbolizes two things. First, it symbolizes the end of order on the island- no more meetings, no more assemblies, none of that, the island was a place of anarchy. Secondly, this destruction symbolizes the end of Ralph's leadership. The boys had become slaves to Jack and his power, their conscience gave in.   Finally, about the novel itself. Golding is quite obviously a fan of Joseph Conrad. The writing style is almost identical, and the subject matter is very similar, with Golding opting to use children (young boys) instead of the men of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The novel moves very quickly and it's rather short (202 pages in my copy.) You'll be immersed in the varying characters and degrees of humanity that they present. Keep in mind, that although Golding's view on humanity may seem very pessimistic, he's writing from his perspective on human nature, something that he witnessed first hand during WWII.

Maybe that's due to the fact that I'm upgrading from the ancient 550, and not the 7X5 series.  The other reviewers are right, the on/off switch can be awkward, and you need a fingernail to push it over to the left.  But that is such a minor complaint, in my opinion.  Also, some people say they like the smoother refresh that the 7X5 series has, and this is more jerky, as you move along your route.  Well, you're not supposed to be watching it when you're driving anyway.  Oh, and it only has 500 waypoints, compared to 1000 on other models.  I'll be lucky if I use 100.  What makes this GPS so remarkable is the voice recognition!  I feel like I'm using Star Trek technology.  It rarely has any problem understanding what I tell it.  Hands free GPS navigation!  I never have to pull over to type a new destination (or try to do it while driving).  I can't imagine any of the minor complaints offsetting the awesomeness of the voice recognition.  Now that it's available, I wouldn't have a GPS unit without it.  If your budget allows for a voice recognition GPS with 1000 waypoints, an improved on/off switch, and smoother screen refresh, then by all means get that one.  But if you're looking to spend about $300, and want voice recognition, do not hesitate to buy the 855.  I wouldn't exchange it for a non-voice recognition unit that has those features that this one lacks.
like	0	First of all, apologies to all of you who are huge fans of this series of books.  I'm sure you'll hate this review, but remember, this is just one person's opinion.  I was drawn to this series due to all of the press it's been receiving lately, and also because I'm up for a good, escapist vampire novel now and then.  I actually bought the whole box set when it came out recently, but am putting my review here (instead of with the boxed set) because I didn't even get past this first book.  The book did not hold my interest at all, and believe me, I tried to like it.  I've been attempting to figure out what the problem is.  It's not the setting; I was born in Louisiana, so the setting was one of the attractions of the book.  It's not the overall, view-from-30,000-feet story; that was fine.  So what was it?  I'd have to say it was more structural than anything else, for lack of a better word.  I found Ms. Harris' writing to be on par with what an average ninth grader might produce.  The characters, even the main ones, were a bit on the superficial side and weren't really fully developed.  The plot details were quite boring, not engaging at all.  The love scenes were a bit cringe-worthy, reminiscent of scenes from poorly executed smut novels (i.e. just as with smut novels, these parts struck me as nothing more than a fantasy on the part of the author).  Overall, the simple fact that I found the book disappointing *IS* the most disappointing part.  That is, if I hadn't had such high hopes, it wouldn't be such a let down.  The story and characters had oodles of potential.

I have 7 lb speakers that have stressed them to the point of almost failure (when mounting on the wall). After changing the mounting position from the side wall to the ceiling they are handling it much better. These mounts are only good for small speakers (like Bose) when wall mounting. If you are going to use them for heavy (capacity maxed) speakers, you should hang them from the ceiling.

It was amazing to watch him over the next year change the way he played with the toy. Initially he just played with the blocks, then threw them in the bucket, dumped them out again. He would also carry the bucket with blocks around by the handle. Later he was able to put in the round one, then another and within a short time all of them. He still likes playing with it. It was apparent that he had a sense of achievement after each new "accomplishment". I highly recommend this toy.

I see that someone hasn't received what they ordered from Jafrum, and I feel bad for them.  I received it faster than I expected, actually, ready to go the moment it came out of the box.

They are meant to be together, but Alex and Nina both think the other party won't be interested because of the age difference - Alex is ten years younger than Nina.  The characters are likeable, especially Fred, but the book was rather predictable.  At the end there are some easily-resolved misunderstandings thrown in that seem to be there just to make the book reach the 200-page mark.

It may not be the most comfortable situation but it should not *hurt*. It's really appalling how many fake "funny or joke reviews" are on this subject. It's sad that a women's health tool has to be the subject of objectification or a joke. I truly encourage all the women I know to get more in touch with their cycles and their cervix. Empower yourself! It's a beautiful thing. A speculum is a wonderful tool!!  I purchased this to become more familiar with my cycles and to also become more familiar with my cervix. You can tell SO much about ovulation by checking your cervix. When you are TTC, this is invaluable. It's a relatively inexpensive tool.   Anyways, this speculum was *not* what I expected at all. One of the blades was much shorter than the other making it impossible to insert. No matter how much lube I used, or how relaxed I was, it wouldn't insert itself comfortably. I chose to buy this one instead of plastic for environmental reasons but I regret the decision as I cannot even use it. I have since ordered a pack of plastic speculums and already used one of those. It fit SO much more comfortably. I was hoping I didn't have to buy plastic but I did.   The shipper did get the item to me in a timely manner so if you'd like to try it for yourself, you can count on fast shipping.   Would definitely not make this purchase again based on the ease of use of this speculum. It hurt too much and I have a pretty decent tolerance for discomfort.   (this all may be TMI but what did you expect in a product review for a speculum?)
like	0	Based on reading Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker and Moneyball, I wondered whether The Big Short would prove to be entertaining and informative.  If you've read some of Lewis' books, you might agree that the "entertaining" part would seem to be a reasonably safe bet.  It turns out, it is.  The Big Short is fast-paced, straightforward, conversational and salty--very much like his earlier works.  Indeed, if you didn't know Michael Lewis had written this book, you could probably guess it.  It is easy reading and very hard to put down.  In short (no pun), The Big Short doesn't disappoint in being entertaining.  In a sense, this book is similar to Moneyball in that Lewis tells his story by following a host of characters that most of us have never heard of--people like Steve Eisman (the closest thing to a main character in the book), Vincent Daniel, Michael Burry, Greg Lippmann, Gene Park, Howie Hubler and others.  How informative is the book?  Well, it may seem that Lewis has his work cut out for himself, since the events of the recent financial crisis are already well known.  More than that, lots of people have their minds made up concerning who the perps of the last few years are--banks and their aggressive managers, "shadow banks" and their even more aggressive managers, hedge funds, credit default swaps, mortgage brokers, the ratings agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Fed's monetary policy, various federal regulators, short sellers, politicians who over-pushed home ownership, a sensationalist media, the American public that overextending itself with excessive borrowing (or that lied in order to get home loans), housing speculators, etc.  The list goes on--and on.  Okay, so you already know this.  The defining aspect of this book, however, is that it asks (and answers) "Who knew?" about the impending financial crisis beforehand.  Who knew--before the financial crisis cracked open for everyone to see (and, perhaps, to panic) in the fall of 2008--that a silent crash in the bond market and real estate derivatives market was playing out?  Indeed, the good majority of this book addresses events that occurred before Lehman's failure in September of 2008.  In describing what led up to the darkest days of the crisis, Lewis does a good job helping the reader to see how the great financial storm developed.  All in all, this is an informative book.  Interestingly, in the book's prologue, Salomon Brothers alumnus Lewis explains how, after he wrote Liar's Poker over 20 years ago, he figured he had seen the height of financial folly.  However, even he was surprised by the much larger losses suffered in the recent crisis compared to the 1980s, which seem almost like child's play now.  For a taste of The Big Short, Steve Eisman was a blunt-spoken "specialty finance" research analyst at Oppenheimer and Co., originally in the 1990s, and he eventually helped train analyst Meredith Whitney, who most people associate with her string of negative reports on the banking industry, primarily from late 2007.  Giving a flavor of his style, Eisman claims that one of the best lines he wrote back in the early 1990s was, "The [XYZ] Financial Corporation is a perfectly hedged financial institution--it loses money in every conceivable interest rate environment."  His own wife described him as being "not tactically rude--he's sincerely rude."  Vinny Daniel worked as a junior accountant in the 1990s (and eventually worked for Eisman), and he found out how complicated (and risky) Wall Street firms were when he tried to audit them.  He was one of the early analysts to notice the high default rates on manufactured home loans, which led to Eisman writing a 1997 report critical of subprime originators.  Michael Burry (later Dr. Michael Burry) was, among other things, a bond market researcher in 2004 who studied Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, and who correctly assessed the impact of "teaser rates" and interest rate re-sets on subprime loans.  In 2005, Burry wrote to his Scion Capital investors that, "Sometimes markets err big time."  How right he would be.  Greg Lippmann was a bond trader for Deutsche Bank, who discussed with Eisman ways to bet against the subprime mortgage market.  Before home prices declined, he noted, for example, that people whose homes appreciated 1 - 5% in value were four times more likely to default than those whose homes appreciated over 10%.  In other words, home prices didn't need to actually fall for problems to develop.  (Of course, home prices fell a lot.)  When Lippmann mentioned this to a Deutsche Bank colleague, he was called a Chicken Little.  To which, Lippmann retorted, "I'm short your house!"  He did this by buying credit default swaps on the BBB-rated tranches (slices) of subprime mortgage bonds.  If that's not a mouthful, read further in the book for a description of Goldman Sachs and "synthetic subprime mortgage bond-backed CDOs."  Then there's the AIG Financial Products story, told through the story of Gene Park, who worked at AIG, and his volatile boss, Joe Cassano.  Did I say this book is informative?  Here's a bit more:  Did you know that a pool of mortgages, each with a 615 FICO score, performs very differently (and better) than a pool of mortgages with half of the loans with a 550 FICO score and half with a 680 FICO score (for a 615 average)?  If you think about it, the 550/680 pool is apt to perform significantly worse, because more of the 550 FICO score loans develop problems.  Think about how that got gamed.  There's more, but hopefully you've gotten the point.  This is a very interesting, entertaining and informative book that accomplishes what it sets out to do.  Chances are you'll enjoy it.

Fortunately I read enough reviews to know this ahead of time and installed the protectors without a problem. Didn't really see the point of the side protection pieces. I did put one piece on to protect from the dreaded antenna attenutation problems, but it made the stainless steel look dingy, so I took it off - wasn't having much antenna problem anyway.   The organge peel effect you get with this protector really detracts from the crispness of the iPhone 4 display. And I dislike the tacky feel this protector has - my fingers don't glide, they skid when I'm using the touch screen. I'll be ordering the Powersupport Crystal screen protector when it comes out. Had very good experience with it on my two previous iPhones. Might keet the ZAGG on the back where the tacky feel has some benefit; especially if the Powersupport doesn't come with a rear protector.

Nothing could prepare me for the actuality that is Kindle.  It integrated seamlessly into my life.  If I'm at the desk, it's beside me; if I'm in the bedroom, it's on the nightstand; I even take the silly thing to the john.  It's so much easier than a book.    I expected it to be a little awkward at first, but it really *does* get lost in your hands.  Suddenly, you look down after a couple of hours of reading, and realize you've been holding it all along and forgotten all about it.  I expected to read novels and blogs on it.  I never expected to be able to download all the .pdf technical manuals that I constantly have to weed through on the computer.  I work effortlessly now, looking at the computer, working through a segment, picking up the Kindle, searching for what I need in the manual, even highlighting it, or putting a note in the manual about how well it works.  Note taking is my big thing.  When I'm looking at a book, I always find note-taking to be an instinct I have to avoid.  I see it as a destructive process.  I don't want to ruin my books.  Further, who can really concentrate on what they're reading with a pen in their hand?  It's two different mindsets.  Yet, with Kindle, I do just that.  I read a segment, I find a passage, I underline it.  I have an opinion, I drop in a note.  A question equals another note.  When I don't understand something, the dictionary is right at the bottom of the screen to define the word or teach me how to pronounce it; or I can surf to the web and find exactly what I need.  It's so much better than surfing the web on my phone - and far more practical.  For one thing, there's no charge except battery power (no pun intended!).  For another, all of my research is in one place.  The book, notes, websites and highlights are all together - as they should be.  I know a lot of people complain that it should have a bright screen so that you can read it at night, or that it should have color.  I say - nay!  The main *strength* of Kindle is that it reads *exactly* like a book.  No eye strain.  No having to turn away every few minutes to relax your eyes; or ending a session of reading with a headache.  No "hot lap" or mousing around to find the right page.  It's just like a book.  You hold it, you turn the page, it's effortless, you forget it's there.  Only what you're reading matters, and that's exactly how it should be.

What I found is for me they are tasty and filling.  I then gave a few of my overweight patients some to try.  They found them to be very helpful.  The very overweight patients lost on average 2lbs+/wk for the last 3 weeks.  Normal weighted people, like myself, haven't lost in pounds, but I feel firmer as do they.  I am a massage therapist, so I am pretty muscular, but I would like to stay healthy and maintain normal eating habits so this bar is great for me for just that reason, but it does seem to help with weight loss as well.  I have tried all the flavors of these bars and they are all pretty tasty...No,they aren't horrid or dry, but they aren't snickers bars either.  Just a fine, not overly done flavor that does fill you up prior to eating.  I ate before lunch and dinner.  Smoothie for breakfast.    Just in case you are wondering the average Nutrition Facts on all the bars are: Total Fat 3g--- Sat. Fat 2g---Trans Fat 0g----Cholesterol 0mg---Sodium 105mg---Carbo's---31g---Fiber 4g----Sugars 13g---Protein 5g---

TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES must be as close to a perfect novel as anyone has written in English.  It is a genuine tragedy with a girl/woman as tragic hero.  It is about life on earth in a way that transcends mere sociology.  It has the grandeur of Milton but concerns itself with the lives of mortal beings on earth, as much with sex as with dirt, blood, milk, dung, animal and vegetative energies.  It concerns itself with only essential things the way the Bible does.  It is almost a dark rendering of the Beatitudes. The story is built with such care and such genius that every incident, every paragraph, reverberates throughout the whole structure.  Surely Hardy had an angel on his shoulder when he conceived and composed this work.  Yet it was considered so immoral in its time that he had to bowdlerize his own creation in order to get it published, at first.  Victorian readers were not prepared for the truth of the lives of ordinary women, or for a great many truths about themselves that Hardy presents.   The use of British history as a hall of mirrors and the jawdropping detail of the landscape of "Wessex" make it the Great English Novel in the way we sometimes refer to MOBY DICK as the Great American Novel, though the works don't otherwise bear comparison.  Melville's great white whale is a far punier creation. Hardy's style is like no one else's.  It is not snappy, as Dickens can be.  It is not fluid and elegant, like George Eliot's.  It can feel labored and awkward and more archaic than either.  It has no journalistic flavor, but is painfully pure and deliberate and dense, echoing Homer or the language of the Old Testament rather than anything we think of as "modern."  Don't start with TESS but with FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, another very beautiful book, where Hardy is at his loosest and wittiest.  Once you have the key to his style, then pick up a good edition of TESS with notes, e.g. Penguin, so you get the full richness of all the literary allusions.  Hardy's lowly shepherds and farmhands move and breathe in a very ancient literary atmosphere.  The effect is not pretentious but timeless.   There is wisdom, poetry and majesty here.  Tess stumbling through the dark and taking her last rest at Stonehenge will send chills up your spine like no other reading experience.  I wonder if anyone can know why there are novels, why we care about them, or what they are capable of, without reading this one.

The throw is not as soft as I expected but it definitely makes up for that in terms of warmth. We really wish it were longer so we could snuggle in it together but it definitely is worth the price I paid for it ($12). My toddler started hogging the throw once she discovered how snuggly it felt and I bought her one for her very own, with which she is extremely pleased! It's the perfect size when used as a toddler blanket and she's kept very warm during cold Wisconsin winter nights.

We would sing the song, read through the entire book, I'd point out the letters etc.  I find this book a very helpful starting point for learning the alphabet, a fun way!  One idea for younger toddlers, when I started we'd just read the letter and skip the other info on the page.  This way the book was more managable for my toddlers short attention span.  I have to say though, he really likes this book. Esp. when we first got it he'd literally sit down with the book and just flip through the pages.  A++
like	0	I loved this book.  Loved it.  I feel that it was very much in synch with Ms. Harris' earlier works in the series where the cohesion comes from a single mystery that runs like a river under the various plotlines (some resolved and some to be resolved).  Also unifying the whole, was the theme of 'family' which allowed us to get to know our favorite characters on a deeper level --really nice at this late stage in the series.  The character developement overall in this installment was spot on and brilliant (ie: Taking one of the series' new characters a full, believable, 180 degrees from sympathetic to psycho). Sookie is still our beloved Sookie, her black humor and sass intact, but now with some welcome maturation and self awareness (Take that Stephanie Plum!)and an ability to actually have some empathy and concern for Eric --oh, and now she will "stake a b***h" if you mess with her or her man! Speaking of whom, it's still our beloved Machiavellian Eric, but now he's realizing that he's got to be more open and honest if Sookie's going to trust him.    There's a return of the likable Bill for Bill fans. (Yay old Bill! Give him a woman he can mollycoddle and talk adorably stilted to for pity's sake.)  And even Sam was awesome and cool --his interactions with Sookie comforting and welcome instead of the yawn fest they've been lately.  It was also nice to have Jason back to being Sookie's big brother and comic relief rather than the absent ne'er do well.  The author was on her game with her descriptions and dialogue as well.  Some favorite quotes that come quickly to mind, "...he was not a happy camper.  Well, he could pitch his tent right alongside mine." and "That looks painful.  Would you like me to nurse it?" (Honestly, the book deserves 5 stars alone for the "chair" scene and Pam calling Sookie "monkey girl"  --too much wicked fun.)  I laughed aloud throughout the book.  Finally, there were a few "True Blood" shoutouts which I really enjoyed (and I include among these, a flipping of Eric's Maker storyline on it's head --way to own it, Ms. Harris, and give us something new along with a sly nod and a wink) and some clever references to past Sookie short stories --nice rewards for the faithful fan.

This came up as a gold box deal, so I thought what the heck and ordered it, as I had seen many positive reviews of the eMedia software.  I received the package and it was *very* light.  I opened it up and laughed as it looked like a kids toy.  I decided that I better not waste my money and returned this kit and to go ahead and invest in a decent starter instrument (I bought a Seagull Coastline S6 Burst GT Guitar ).  I may go ahead and buy the standalone eMedia Guitar Method disc, but for now, I'm doing fine with the free lessons [...]

It's a little messy, I had to do 2 applications, took about a day and a half til I could go 'bandaid-less' without the paste. 1 actually came off yesterday (started the whole process 4 days ago) and the others definitely look like they are going to soon. It is a little painful & itchy (not to mention gross) but nothing awful. Those small round bandaids are perfect for this. I'll update this once they start to heal (the one that came off kind of looks like a little burn wound right now) and maybe I'll have during/after photos then. Also, it didn't really affect the healthy skin around it very much, and I know I wasn't very careful about applying it. Overall, it's worth the money. Careful about putting this in a place where others can see, it'll take a bit to heal and it turns the spot BLACK until it falls off. Wanted to also say the customer service is GREAT, the guy was super quick to reply to my emails and very nice/professional. I'll update in a few weeks!  update 3/27: All gone but a few holes/divots are left behind, not healed yet though and still red. Using neosporin and bandaids 24/7.  update 4/6: Divots have filled in, looking SO much better, just a bit red and discolored. Just started using prefer on scar treatment.  update 5/26: about half of the moles are starting to grow back (although smaller and flat). others are scars that lighten every week but still quite noticeable. will reapply to the ones reappearing.

Then come back to it within a day or two (or sooner, if you are so inclined) and give it a second listen from beginning to end.  If you do that, unless you really dislike "this kind of music", I'm relatively certain you will be enchanted with the album permanently.  Plastic Beach is truly an amazing work.  Keep the following thoughts in mind as you navigate through other reviews of Plastic Beach.  First, immediately discount any that express disillusion that this album is not the sequel to its stellar predecessor, Demon Days (2005).  Comparisons to Demon Days (and, by extension, the 2001 self-titled debut album) are useful to the extent they allow you to see how the Gorillaz sound has evolved over the course of a decade.  To truly appreciate this work fairly, however, you should judge it on the strength of its own merits.  Moreover, this review is being written the day of its United States release, and there are currently a handful of reviews that rate the album poorly.  These reviews seem to have a few things in common: they show very little regard to not only the craftsmanship and genius behind this work, but seem to be written from a jaded aspect that belies someone writing against a deadline and only taking time to listen to the album once (if they even listened that much).  That said, while this album isn't perfection personified, it really is quite good, easily earning a 9 out of 10 rating.  Below I will grade each track individually, but first I want to address the album as a whole.  Clocking in at just under an hour, this album is a cohesive whole that takes you on a sonic journey full of unlikely sights and stops along the way (often even within the individual songs themselves).  It's not surprising that this album in its formative stages was originally named "Carousel" by its loving architect, musical wizard Damon Albarn.  The album is a special kind of ride.  At times the album makes you think, but not too hard, because it doesn't purport to take a stand on any of the issues it brings to the surface.  Other times the album makes you want to sing along, but not too loudly, because you want to be able to appreciate the artistry at work in each song.  Most importantly, the album makes you feel emotion.  Whether it be exhilaration, abandon, wonderment, or disquiet, you feel it with force.    On to the snapshots of each song in the US track-list.  1) Orchestral Intro -- 4/5       This track lets you know you are headed somewhere important and maybe just a little bit different.  If you listen closely, the fade-out carries a hint of distortion, which I take as an indication that the nature you are about to experience is quite unnatural.  2) Welcome to The World of The Plastic Beach -- 3/5       There's probably no truer living representation of hip-hop than Snoop Dogg, and he serves as an apropos master of ceremonies welcoming you to your destination.  Snoop has always had a unique five-star flow, and it's on full display on this track.  Ever since his debut album Doggystyle (1993), however, he has an uneven track-record of bringing the heat to whatever song he's spitting rhymes on.  The frustrating thing about Snoop is that both the listener and he are in on the fact that many times he is as lazy a lyricist as the flow of his trademark delivery, and that is indeed the case in this song, using trite expressions like "Boss Dogg" (not once, but twice), "mirror, mirror on the wall" and "crack-a-lackin".  For the record, my wife thinks that Snoop did exactly what he was supposed to do on this track: introduce, not steal the stage.  Regardless, aided by the sick horns of the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, this song helps get you in the mood to groove.  3) White Flag -- 3/5       A light, flighty orchestral piece by the Lebanese National Orchestra For Oriental and Arabic Music (I think I got that right...) takes you to Bollywood and some other exotic places you've probably never been to as you skip across the sand of Plastic Beach for the first time.  You are suddenly greeted by a hot potato back-and-forth rap between British grime rap stars Kano and Bashy set to a dub beat.  Their wordplay forms the musical meat sandwiched between the previously mentioned beginning of the track and its conclusion, which is a synthesis of the orchestral part and the dub beat.  The final outcome is both an unlikely treat and treatise from your locale.  4) Rhinestone Eyes -- 5/5       This song has video single written all over it.  2D's vocals take center stage for the first time.  It's a heavily synthesized pop tune complete with catchy not-quite-a-chorus repeats of the phrase "Love Electric-tric-tric-tric-tric" that you can only imagine yourself chanting alongside Noodle.  This song also carries that signature "Gorillaz sound" of keyboards and drumbeats that can be traced back to their debut album.  This song is definitely one of the reasons I regard the album so highly.  5) Stylo -- 5/5       The lead single and video from the album.  "Feel Good, Inc." it is not, but this fact only adds to "Stylo"'s charm.  An unyielding beat accentuated by an insidious, haunting repetition of the phrase "Overload", a slick verse from Mos Def, and the undeniable raw power of Bobby Womack make this song an instant classic.  You don't get "Stylo" at first, you just know it has a catchy beat.  After multiple listens, though, you realize the song is consummate.  It is worth mentioning that essential to the whole Gorillaz concept is the fact that their music is both an audio and visual experience.  Taken in that light, the promotional video shot for this track by co-creator Jaime Hewlett does an excellent job of immediately engaging the audience and drawing them into Plastic Beach.   6) Superfast Jellyfish -- 4/5       Rumored to be the second video and single from the album, this song is dripping with sinister irony.  De La Soul become the first rap artists to score a follow-up opportunity with the Gorillaz, and they do not disappoint in this twisted indictment of consumerism, cloaked in a breakfast meal jingle.  Though not as in-your-face and extreme as, say, Johnathan Swift's 1729 pamphlet "A Modest Proposal" the implications of this song are meant to be frightening.  Gruff Rhys also lends his vocals to the track that is both scary and scary good.    7) Empire Ants -- 5/5       The beautiful, peaceful beginning of this song shows Plastic Beach at its most serene.  The guitar makes a rare appearance, and it strums blissfully along in concert with 2D's singing and piano accompaniment.  Then, halfway through, the song it improbably explodes into a shimmering disco-pop tune completed by the vocals of Yukumi Nagano from the Swedish group, Little Dragon.  This may very well be the album's best song, though "Broken" gives it a serious run for its money a few songs later.  8) Glitter Freeze -- 2/5       Personal preference here, but this is my least favorite song of the lot.  Mostly instrumental with a few sparse words from curmudgeon Mark E Smith, this song is an aural assault on your eardrums and mind.  Often, after this song ends, I'm relieved, because it feels like I've just been willingly violated, which might just be a microcosm for one of the tenets of the album, namely the willful violation of our own home planet.  But just as soon as you begin to contemplate that we are off to our next song.  9) Some Kind of Nature -- 3/5       Many are split on this Lou Reed guest effort, where his sing-song voice takes Albarn's piano-based beatnik ditty for a quick spin.  Some hail it as the watermark of Plastic Beach, while others decry it as its nadir.  The song comes pre-loaded with a fully realized chorus and simulated clapping that beckons singing along.  I'm still not sure what to make of it all, I find myself in neither of the previously mentioned camps of supporters or naysayers, but I believe it is a solid addition to the album regardless.  10) On Melancholy Hill -- 5/5       An endearing track.  Listen closely and you'll hear a rhythm that lies beneath Coldplay's "Viva La Vida" and the song it borrowed heavily from "Foreigner Suite" by Cat Stevens.  I doubt it is intentional, and it is otherwise completely overshadowed by what is quite an uncharacteristically upbeat, almost saccharine ode from Albarn.  While this song is technically 2D from Gorillaz, it is also every bit just Damon being himself.  11) Broken -- 5/5       My favorite of the album.  The song evokes Clint Eastwood with its pseudo-riff on "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" theme by Hugo Montenegro.  The song is beyond phenomenal, and I think this is no coincidence, another 2D solo joint that can just as easily be seen as Damon Albarn as himself.  The beat is seriously sick and haunting at the same time.  The production sounds as if lifted off a top-flight hip-hop producer's private instrumental songbook, but it is so much more due to Damon's vocals dominating the song.  I don't care what he is singing about in this song, I just want to listen and feel his lament.  It's why this album, and its creator, are one-of-a-kind.  12) Sweepstakes -- 4/5       Hated this song at first, due to the repetition of the beat and the rhyme.  However, keep listening: the lyrics actually change, not in their content, but in their delivery, just as the song itself transforms into something greater than the sum of its parts.  Several minutes of repetition in, you are greeted again by the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble amplified this time with a percussion section that evokes an American college football halftime band performance.  Mos Def is most definitely a winner on this track.  Hip-hop heads will prefer this track to the rest of the album's offerings, which speaks to the fact that there is almost something for everyone here.  13) Plastic Beach -- 3/5       I can't hear Mick Jones' contribution to this song, but ex-Clash band-mate (and frequent Albarn-collaborator) Paul Simonon's strings sound pretty good on the title track.  The track is funky, a little bit eerie, and definitely keeps the mood of the album and its maybe-fictional-maybe-real setting at the center of your mind as your trek through Plastic Beach nears its end.  14) To Binge -- 5/5       For those not expecting Blur to ever make a guest appearance on this album -- well, don't worry, they didn't.  But this is as close as you'll ever get, since even the most casual Gorillaz fan will notice that 2D doesn't sound anything like himself on this record.  In fact, he sounds just like Albarn from Blur during the height of the 90s Britpop era.  This time, however, he is trading verses with guest singer Yukumi Nagano who appears in her second contribution to the album.  The song is like a fading sunset, with clouds developing as the song itself fades out.  If this is the final album from the Gorillaz, I think this song serves as its official good-bye.  And even though two more tracks come after this one, they feel more like encores than anything.  15) On The Cloud of Unknowing -- 4/5       But what encores they are!  Powerful, powerful stuff from Bobby Womack here, coupled with chilling and atmospheric instrumentation from Sinfonia ViVA, make this a contemplative song, even if the first few listens give little clue as to what you and singer are contemplating.  It can be simply described as a pretty song.  16) Pirate Jet -- 4/5       I have an image of an animated pogo-stick or slinky, or something bouncy like that just hopping all over this song like a little kid.  "It's all good news now, because we left the taps running for a hundred years."  Call it tongue-wagging sarcastic optimism at the prospect that even as foolish and wasteful we humans are, Nature will adapt to whatever is thrown at it, and persevere.  That's my take, at least.  And with that, the final opus in the Gorillaz trilogy (this is widely rumored to be the final album for the group) comes to a close.  If you have made it to the end of this review, thank you.  I had fun sharing my rambling thoughts on what I feel is a great album.  If you have not already purchased this album, give it a try, you will be happy you did.

I first thought this show would be awful, but I sat down and watched it--and it was love.  Truly.  It's rare to find a show that can be taken seriously that also made me laugh out loud in every episode.  The writing was extraordinary, and the actors/actresses were absolute gold.  It was really like watching a movie each time around.  Yet again, Fox shot itself in the foot and iced another good show.  Nonetheless, at least the DVD is soon to come.  At least they had the decency to do that.  Come on, sing it with me: "Take my love, take my land, take me where I cannot stand.  But I don't care--I'm still free.  You can't take the skies from me..."

It didn't take long to realize "Fallen" was going to make its way into my rotation of discs I listen to a lot. I found myself anxiously waiting to hear what came next while listening to it, which rarely happens. Their music is hauntingly dark, and beautiful at the same time, and it does have its "rock" moments, thanks to some really nice guitar sounds. And I *love* Amy's voice! The production is huge sounding; the songs are beautifully textured with keyboards, strings and layered back up vocals. This is not a 'rap-metal' band, if you've only heard the "Bring Me To Life" single. There's a lot of depth to this group that you might not be expecting to hear ... and a lot of interesting things going on. Definitely not a "throw on at a party" CD - But one that I find myself wanting to explore beginning to end, again and again. Besides the lead single, I really like "Tourniquet", "Going Under", "Haunted", "My Immortal", "Whisper" and "My Last Breath." The rest of the songs are also very good ... totally worth picking up, and hopefully an indication of more brilliance to come. Awesome stuff - a CD that's worth your attention.

It would be four more years before I myself went away to school, though I knew the story nearly by heart by then.   I reread Mockingbird every year at Eastertime, though I am not particularly religious, nor do I mark this time in any other particularly hopeful way. Many true bibliophiles I know still talk about this book and the way it changed them forever.  It deserves better than to be assigned reading to captive 6th and 10th graders. They read it then because they have to, not because some kind librarian or insightful teacher, or intuitive parent, sends it their way, like a lucky charm.  I am not a Southerner and unless you can call a Western New York born mother and an Owensboro, Kentucky bred father any sort of meaningful Southern influence in my life, I do not know why this story fits my life so well. It filled a need I never even knew was there until I closed its covers on first reading it.   I am a fan of both the writing and its message, its dual edged sword of hope and sorrow, the tragicomic aspect of its mood and setting.   I wanted to be Scout as a tomboy girl and when grown, to be Atticus; my cats have borne those monikers well.   I only wish my husband had not told me I could not name my own son after my hero.   A rare case where the movie and its inspiration are as beloved as its author, To Kill a Mockingbird, N words and all, needs to be read more---and not just as some lame excuse for a paper writing exercise. Scout, Jem and Dill come alive in these pages. They have meaning in their world and in this one.  The dialogue, minus a few colloquiallisms, is readable and real. You will laugh out loud at times when Scout makes her mind known to you.  You'll wish Atticus was a real man. Maybe you'll even feel a little guilty about wanting him to replace your father in real life.  And Tom Robinson? He'll break your heart. He should.  I was once told my Coleman family had some relation to Harper Lee's father's family and, if that bit of fiction has even the remotest grain of truth to it, I am even happier now than I was just having imagined it.   PLEASE READ THIS BOOK.

With the 14-45mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, the G1 is about one-third the weight of my Sony A900 SLR with a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens.  Of course, the G1's 12 megapixel sensor cannot compete with the A900's 24 megapixel sensor, and the 14-45 lens is neither as fast as, nor of equal quality to, the 24-70 lens, but the portability of the G1 means that I take it with me more often than I take my A900.  The Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 Digital Camera Case Gadget Bag  fits the G1 with 14-45 lens perfectly and attaches to my belt via a Velcro strap.  And the Canon WS20 Wrist Strap for all Canon Camcorders  is a convenient alternative if you don't want a camera strap around your neck.  If I were to list all of the features of the G1 that I like, this review would be rather long, so here is a short list of my favorite features:  1. All of the buttons that control focus, metering, ISO, etc. are well positioned and easy to use.  2. A real time histogram may be displayed if desired.  3. In manual focus mode, the image is magnified in the high resolution electronic viewfinder so that precise focus may be achieved.  4. If desired, images may be stored in RAW (RW2) format in addition to the limiting JPEG format.  The RAW alternative allows for better noise suppression (see below).  A consequence of the small 14-45 lens is that the lens is not particularly fast and so does not permit low light photography.  However, the Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 Aspherical Pancake Lens for Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Cameras  remedies this problem.  Also available are the Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0 Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic Digital SLR Cameras  and Panasonic 45-200mm f/4.0-5.6 Lumix G Vario MEGA OIS Zoom Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic and Olympus Micro Four Thirds Cameras  lenses that extend the zoom range to 14-400mm (35mm equivalent).  And the camera plus all four lenses weigh a mere four pounds, so can easily be taken along on a hike.  For those who would like to capture video, the Panasonic DMC-GH1 12MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 1080p HD Video , Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF1 12.1MP Micro Four-Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-45mm Lens  and the somewhat larger Nikon D5000 12.3 MP DX Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR Lens and 2.7-inch Vari-angle LCD  are attractive alternatives.  But I don't shoot video, so the G1 is a low priced solution to my need for a portable camera.  The two weaknesses of the Panasonic G1 are:  1. The dynamic range of the sensor is a bit limited, with the consequence that it is fairly easy to blow out the highlights in an image.  I haven't found a good solution to this problem, other than to shoot in RAW mode and underexpose at bit when I want to capture cloud detail.  2. The sensor introduces a fair amount of noise above ISO 800.  However, this problem is nicely remedied if one shoots in RAW mode and uses Adobe Lightroom 3 to suppress noise.  This approach easily extends the useful ISO from 800 to 1600, and in some cases to 3200.  Update: Panasonic has recently introduced the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G2 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 3-Inch Touch Screen LCD and 14-42mm Lumix G VARIO f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens (Black)  and Panasonic Lumix DMC-G10 12.1 MP Live MOS Interchangeable Lens Camera with 14-42mm Lumix G Vario f/3.5-5.6 MEGA OIS Lens  cameras.  Both of these cameras can record video.  Also, it appears that the Sony Alpha NEX-3 and NEX-5 cameras, with their APS-C sensors, provide better image quality than any of the Panasonic cameras.  However, as of this writing, the Sony system does not provide as broad a zoom range as does the Panasonic system.

Naturally, I was left shaking my head with everyone else, wondering what drove someone so disciplined to make such a mess of his life. Steve Helling's book answers some of those questions, though it would be impossible to answer all of them. It is not a book of sensationalism or speculation, but well-written journalism that give us an inside look at both the life and the downfall of a paragon who never asked to be placed on the pedestal on which the world displayed him.  This book follows the clues that tell us some of what makes Tiger Woods who he is, starting with the breadcrumbs that were dropped long before his birth. While a bemused public looked on as a toddler putted against Bob Hope, not one of them could have predicted that that same child would grow to be not only the world's greatest golfer, but also a hero and role model with such a carefully constructed persona that even his handlers would forget that a real person lay behind the smoke and mirrors. Tiger Woods was not a god, but an unforgiving public would punish him for not acting like one.  While he is responsible for his mistakes, one can't help but wonder who Tiger would have been had he been allowed to be Tiger Woods rather than a meticulously crafted ideal.

Received the item promptly just a few days before the phone arrived.  It included a front screen protector and a cleaning cloth.    The fit is pretty accurate and serves the purpose for protecting the sides and back of the phone considering it was likely manufactuered with limited specs available for the iPhone 4.  My only complaint is with the finish - there is a raised seam all the way around the sides (and over the round volume buttons) where it's aparent the two halves the of the case were fused together or the injection mold wasn't cut properly. And the edges of the open cutouts for the headphone, mute button, dock connector, etc has a similar yet smaller lip around the openings.  A minor complaint with the screen protector that it has that "rainbow" or oily look to it when held at an angle to the room light when the phone is off or on standby.  But viewing the phone directly you can't see it.  But for my needs - having a case and screen protector available for the day I got my phone for a inexpensive price - this case meets my needs.  I plan to replace it in the future as other product become available and use this case as a back up.  (Pictures of the seams coming soon)

I hope this review may ultimately save some of you some time. :)  I have been looking for a phone with a high-resolution, fast camera, and PDA-like features.  I use the camera when traveling to clients' premises, and am surprised how many devices made by Apple, RIMM, Palm and others treat cell-phone cameras as an adolescent feature that wastes the time of employees (like surfing emails and internet cannot be abused this way).  As someone who needs the coverage of the Verizon network in my area, not too many phones fit into the above two categories -- particularly without the need to buy a $30/month data plan.  I intentionally delayed using my NE2, knowing that Verizon often releases phones in June.  After nearly choosing the Samsung Omnia i910 and LG Dare, I'm glad I did.  I read in other Amazon reviews that some user's of the Sammy 910 made the effort to set the phone up properly so that they didn't have to dig through menus.  But personally, I found the i910 very difficult to do almost anything, even with shortcuts right on its desktop, even after trying it out 6 times at Verizon stores.  I'd hate to tell a relative, "Here's my phone, go make a call!"  It's excellent 5mpix camera almost convinced me, but it was too hard to text in either landscape or portrait, and it requires the $30/mon data plan, plus has a non-standard headphone jack.  The LG Dare was much simpler to pick-up an use, although (without having tried calibration adjustments) I found I made mistakes every time I did a sample text message with it's touch screen, in either orientation.  The camera was also slow at times, especially when using auto-focus, taking as much as 2 seconds to take a picture, and more to wait for the camera to prompt you with the save/erase options.  Enter the enV Touch (and in some similar respects, the LG enV3 VX9200 Phone, Blue (Verizon Wireless)  or the LG enV3 VX9200 Phone, Maroon (Verizon Wireless) .  Finally, a company has figured out a way to keep a real, non-touch-screen qwerty board embedded in an updated, semi-smart phone, especially for those of us who cannot or do not like haptic-feedback touch screens.  Personally, I prefer the center-located space bar, although some of the older enV user's may need time to get used to this.  The keyboard, with my fairly large, iron-grip hands, is easier to use than any touch screen keyboard I've tried, and the 3.2 megapixel camera is one of only a few Verizon phones that offers better than 3 megapix resolution -- shameful in my opinion.  Pictures snap quickly too, in less than 1 second.  The full 3" screen viewfinder makes you feel as if you are using a devoted still camera, although I'm noticing that I have to be a bit careful how I hold the phone so as not to cover the sensor.  This will improve with practice.  But about that front touchscreen -- I am very impressed.  Even without a hard keyboard, this would have been the first phone from any US provider where I can actually type out a text message, completely error-free, using only the traditional numeric keypad in portrait mode.  And getting there is easier too -- the tab-up feature to use the touch screen is very easy and intuitive.  Screen resolution is very good, though perhaps not quite as leading edge as the iPhone or Storm color and resolution.  However, the screen is large enough to see the touch keyboard and a large enough portion of a text or email message without having to scroll through as much as with the Dare/Omnia.  But the phone is also fast -- my old Motorola motorazr had ongoing slow-responsiveness to pictures, notepad activation, even ringing for incoming calls!  The enV Touch is fastest phone I've used, with a near-instant 1/4th second or better response to opening or activating almost anything.  This iPhone-like device also does not require a data plan if you just need a feature-rich cell phone without always-on email.  However, at $1.99/MB, I will have to try out email push and browsing to see if a data plan may yet be desirable.  I travel to Canada frequently, and hope not to have any "always-on" data roaming fees -- I have read horror stories about iPhones incurring $600 bills as owners blithely cross borders or even roaming within the US.  But to my current, possibly wrong understanding, I don't think this phone automatically data-roams.  The phone also offers airplane mode and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack -- finally, no more need to take an iPod and cell phone and camera with me on trips.  Now only if we had unlocked GPS...maybe this will work with Google Maps?  Another interesting device I'm looking at purchasing is the Motorola MOTOROKR T505 Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone  which blue-tooths the phone's audio or phone calls to the car stereo -- safer for calls and convenient for music.  Another nice change:  The CLEAR and END keys on the front screen are well separated now -- no accidentally erasing an unsent message when you thought you were backspacing.  It's not perfect.  Despite the terrific 16GB capacity, Verizon's menu system still retains a 200 text-message limit.  Wha??  After nearly 10 years with this design, couldn't this be a tiny bit larger by now?   Of course, that's a Verizon issue, not really LG's mistake, but since this phone is currently only used on Verizon's network, it's an issue.  The phone is a little bit wider at .61 inches than comparable, non-keyboarded competitors.  I gladly accept this trade-off for the convenience of two styles of keyboards though.  It's also little taller than the similar enV3.  So far, that's all I can say on the con side.  As much as I love the touch screen, it's still not what I'd consider a true iPhone contender though, which with a new release today, seems like it still has a more vibrant display and of course much better apps.  But the enV Touch was, for me, the closest Verizon phone to the iPhone, if only because it seems so intuitive, and it is easily the best cell phone I've ever owned.  As I use the phone, I will update the review with notable pros and cons.
like	0	Although "Deep Impact" invariably gets compared to "Armageddon", I think it's more appropriate to compare it against all other disaster movies. Viewed in that light, it not only surpasses "Armageddon", but every other film in the genre.  Unlike most disaster epics, "Deep Impact" is character driven. I think this is a direct effect of its having been directed by a woman rather than a man. While the special effects are there and are impressive, what drives this film are the emotions of the excellent ensemble cast. All of them ring true, from the occasional duplicitousness of the government bureaucrats, to the real tear jerking moments of those facing tough life and death decisions, to the small intimate moments. It's powerful enough stuff that I have to believe that a lot of the negative reaction the film elicited vis-a-vis "Armageddon" came from guys who don't like their action movies to move them to the verge of tears in public.  All disaster films depend on a hook to set them up. In this respect, most fall far short of realism and believability. Of ones that come immediately to mind, only the cosmic collision movies and "The Towering Inferno" had realistic setups.  All disaster films depend on the heros to come up with some way to save the day. Of the ones with a believable setup, many still fall short of believable and/or technically accurate resolutions. This is where "Armageddon" failed miserably. Mimi Leder had expert advice from NASA and it shows. "Armageddon" has some impressive training facilities shots from NASA, but ignored the actual technology. Very early in "Armageddon", when I saw the two shuttles docking with the space station by coming in from opposite directions, performing clearly aerodynamic banking maneuvers, I was ready to start pelting the screen with rotten tomatoes!  Giving the devil his due, both films glossed over the full impact of operations in the microgravity environment of the comet's surface.  Still, it's the raw emotions that elevate "Deep Impact" above its genre, not just the technical stuff. It's actually best in its quiet moments. Among the ones that clearly stand out:  The president (Morgan Freeman) tries to continue to maintain an upbeat message as each plan successively fails. His press conferences and the dialog around them rings true.  The dialog between the reporter (the usually annoying Tea Leoni) and her mother (Vanessa Redgrave) also rings with truth.  The ultimate reconciliation between the reporter and her father (Maximilian Schell) just before the end reflects the bitterness of choices each has made in getting to that point.  The reunion of the kid who helped discover the comet (Elijah Wood) and his girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski), oblivious for the moment to what was going on around them - again, this simply rings true.  The astronaut observing wryly, "Well, the good news is that we'll all have high schools named after us." No melodramatics, no macho heroism, just someone injecting a sense of humor into a shared fate she has accepted as necessary to save the people they love. My favorite line in the film.  From start to finish, this film is a class act. A realistic film that carries an emotional impact to be expected of its serious subject matter. Part of this impact is that you can't always guess in advance which characters will and will not survive. Of the ones who don't survive, not all face their fate gracefully, but all are believable.  This movie began my fandom of Mimi Leder, who I consider to be one of the best directors working today - not always commercial, but always excellent. This is on my short list of my top ten favorite movies of all time. Highly recommended!

I'm telling you, I use this thing constantly and it works like a champ!  It is powerful enough for me to cut all my brass and aluminum with the precision of that of a doctor.  For as handy as this tool is--I'd pay twice as much to get one if need be.  I've had mine for 5 months too. One HUGE word of advice.  WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES!  I know this may sound lame, but it saved my @ss!!!  When cutting some tubing, my disk exploded at full RPM's and the shrapnel hit me in the goggles.  (Of course I had my fat head over top of it while I was cutting)  Just be careful.  The tool is A+, but the little thing could be dangerous if you slack on the safety.

True, her life is full of drama and boy troubles, but for Bella who sees herself as a danger magnet life holds much much more. Edward Cullen, her ever-handsome boyfriend who just happens to be a vampire, breaks her heart when he leaves after Bella receives a near-fatal paper cut at her eighteenth birthday party. Realizing that his family no matter how determined to avoid human blood, can within seconds be overwhelmed with tempation and violence leads him to place Bella's safety ahead of his own desires. To say that Bella is devastated is an understatment, she becomes zombie-like in her loss, a fact which is finally realized when Bella and one of her friends are watching a Zombie movie. "It wasn't until almost the very end, as I watched a haggard zombie shambling after the last shrieking survivor, that I realized what the problem was. The scene kept cutting between the horrified face of the heroine, and the dead emotionless face of her pursuer, back and forth as it closed the distance. And I realized which one resembled me the most. . . But it was ironic, all things considered, that, in the end, I would wind up a zombie. I hadn't seen that one coming. Not that I hadn't dreamed of becoming a mythical monster once--just never a grotesque, animated corpse. . . It was depressing to realize that I wasn't the heroine anymore, that my story was over." (106) But Bella's story is far from over. Reintroduce into the picture, Jacob Black, the young man who first shared with Bella the fact that she was falling in love with a vampire, this new friendship reenergizes Bella's existence and gives her a reason to continue on. But is her friendship with Jacob any safer for her than her relationship with Edward was? Or is Jacob hiding a dangerous secret of his own? Is Edward out of the picture for good, or will he make a comeback to try to reclaim her heart? Stephenie Meyer's novel NEW MOON, sequel to TWILIGHT, is an exciting read, and one that I highly recommend.

First a DSC-P50 circa 2001, then a couple of random ones I purchased new and wound up selling because they had poor picture quality. Then in 2005 I purchased a Sony DSC-W7 (7.2 mp) point-and-shoot. This is a good little camera but the PQ has always been a little hit and miss. I would say I got one or two good shots out of every 100.  Some problems with the W7 were autofocus that didn't focus properly (especially in indoor, low-light conditions), redeye was pervasive (even with the redeye reduction feature turned on), and shutter lag time. (One feature I liked about the W7 was the inclusion of an optical viewfinder, which it seems most of the manufacturers have now abandoned on these small digital cameras.)  Most of these problems seem to be addressed with the newest (2010) generation of Sony DSC point-and-shoots. I decided this was the time to replace the W7, and it came down to a choice between a DSC-W330 and DSC-W370. After taking some test photos in the store, and sending those photos to my personal computer at home for analysis, I decided to purchase the W370.  The W370 does not have an optical viewfinder, but it has everything else, and does everything right. The low-light, indoor shooting that the W7 could not handle is not an issue at all for the W370. Each indoor shot has been clear and well-focused, with exquisite background detail in shot after shot. In 10 test shots, only 1 came out bad, whereas with previous Sonys there might be 4 good shots and 6 bad.  The quality is light years ahead of the W330. I was attracted initially to the W330 because of its sleek look and small form factor (the W370 does not have this sex appeal), but the W370 blew the 330 out of the water in terms of photo quality, especially autofocus (always sharp) and redeye reduction (no redeye or hint of redeye at all in shot after shot).  In sum, I purchased the W370 and haven't looked back. This is an excellent little camera and everything a digital camera should be. Takes excellent photos whether indoors or out, natural light or artificial, bright conditions or low, etc. I highly recommend this product.

She was also raised by her mother who gave her an introduction to life as a bonobo.  The rest of the story is about what happens after her parents are killed and she is rescued and taken to the U.S. by Jenny.    First of all you must suspend reality to enjoy this book.  Most people seem willing to do that, with the popularity of vampire stories and Harry Potter.    Clearly I loved this book.  It is a good story, well written and just plain fun.  From the beginning I knew everything was not going to turn out okay so I prepared myself for tragedy but it came in a different way than I expected.  The way Jenny learns to love Lucy and becomes a mother to her is lovely to read.  Lucy's friendship with Amanda gives me hope that there are good people out there who really care about something other than themselves.  The same can be said for the Randalls who rescue the damsels in distress more than once.    I liked the sense of place wherever the story takes us.  I so enjoyed seeing the world through Lucy's eyes as she tries to become an American teenager.    This book should be popular with teens and adults alike.  It is light reading and goes fast.  I was sorry when it was over, as I wanted to know much more.  I hope it gets made into a movie.  I am so sick of vampire movies, I think this would be far more heartfelt.
like	0	Better than both "Seven" and "Natural Born Killers", director Matthew Bright's "Freeway" is a looseleaf modern view of Red Riding Hood where Reese Witherspoon plays Red traveling to Grandma's house.  Only she takes this trip after her prostitute mother and junkie stepdad are arrested, she escapes the cluthces of foster care, she says goodbye to her fiancee who is then murdered in a driveby shooting, she hitches a ride with a psycho who turns out to be a mass murderer, she kills a few people, ends up in lockup, escapes, finally makes it to Gradma's house, where some more bloody action takes place.  Oh yes, she has homosexual and heterosexual sex, spends a lot of time saying the "F" word, brutalizes most anyone that gets in her way, and otherwise creates mayhem for everybody. Sounds like your typical Reese Witherspoon role, eh? No, not by a long shot.  But one thing about her role -- she is fantastic, out of this world great. She is twice the actress in this role she was playing June Carter Cash, for which she won an Oscar as best actress. On the basis of these roles, Witherspoon must be considered one of the best actresses extant right now.  As the description here and on Amazon indicates, this movie presses the envelope of the "R" rating as far as possible without slipping over into NC-17. There is gory, bloody violence throughout this film, nudity and more "F" and "F"ing talk than you heard by Matt Damon when he played that low-class genius at Harvard. Someone told me they said "F" 147 times in that movie. Witherspoon herself must say it that many times here.  But none of this diminishes the astonishing electricity and action that swallows the viewer right from the opening scene, where junkie-hooker mom gets arrested and weirdo-junkie stepdad forces Reese to do the nasty while mom's out earning a living. There is an uncompromising level of reality in these characterization, too, although it's clearly an over the top psycho young Sutherland plays.  In an astonishing bit of casting, squeeky clean prom queen type Brooke Shields is cast as the uptight, upscale wife to lurid pervent and child molester Sutherland, whose character is even more disgusting than Witherspoon's. While everyone wants Sutherland rubbed out, Witherspoon manages to keep viewer sympathy because of for her terrible place in life even throughout her ongoing antisocial activities. Other players, incluidng Dan Hedaya as a cop with sympathies all over the place, contribute a lot to this film.  This is recommended for viewers unafraid to look inside the dark side of our culture where youngsters like the one Witherspoon plays actually exist. There is nothing pretty or orderly about this movie; much of it seems upside down. But it is unrelentingly exciting and is full of action in almost every scene, action you may never have seen in a film before.

While a variety of hardware form factors, some even technically superior to the competition, have come out, the software continued to look incredibly boring compared to the iPhone, Android, and even Blackberry. The main selling points consisted of "It runs windows and has a start button like you're used to on a computer" and "We have Office and sync with Outlook!". While these may have appealed to some business customers, the consistently shrinking market share of Windows phones demonstrated their lack of appeal to consumers as the recent smartphone boom hit.   With the HD2 this trend may finally be coming to an end. In conjunction with HTCs beautiful Sense interface, some aggressive hardware, and some genuine innovations, the HD2 is a Windows phone I can actually use and recommend. Let's start with the pros and follow up with a few drawbacks.   **Hardware**  -The 1ghz Snapdragon processor coupled with 448mb of ram is blazing fast. This is the fastest speed in a phone currently available. The HD2 loads everything quickly, and can run multiple apps at the same time. You can feel how fast the phone runs by playing with it for a few minutes. Gone are the sluggish Windows Phones of old, constantly running out of memory and crashing. The HD2 is fast and has top notch hardware and you can feel it.   -The screen is huge: 4.3 inches and stretching from corner to corner. The Resolution at 800x480 pixels means you'll see much more on that big screen than average. That means more room for icons and that sexy weather display on the main screen.   -The HD2 supports 3g on T-mobile, including the upcoming higher speed 3g. This means the fastest downloads and best call quality available. Note: the phone does NOT have ATTs 3g bands and the 3g will not work if you're using it unlocked on ATT.   -5mp camera with auto focus and 2 LEDs. 5mp is the highest we see on most phones, and the camera looks great. Having not 1 but 2 LEDs for flash seems a bit silly but works well. The phone even comes standard with a little flashlight app for a blindingly bright way to see in the dark.   -Included 3.5mm jack - this is becoming standard on most phones, and it's great to see it on the HD2. This allows you to use standard headphones without an adapter when playing music or listening to the built in FM Radio.  -Included wifi, bluetooth, and a hardware (real) GPS for turn by turn directions round out all the bells and whistles included in the phone.   -Battery life is similar to most smartphones. You will easily get a day's use without having to charge, but most likely you'll have to plug it in at night.   **Interface**  -HTC Sense is what really makes the phone shine here. This part of the software is done by HTC, not Windows, and runs on top of standard Windows Mobile 6.5 professional. HTC Sense expands on the previous TouchFLO 3d interface and enhances the way customers interact with the phone. Sense creates the beautiful Today screen, animations for messages, social networking features. It also lets you interact with the phone in unique ways, such as pinching to zoom. Some of these features are so close to the iPhone that Apple has recently filed lawsuits against HTC.   -The home screen is customizable, though not quite to the extent of Android phones. It lets you place a few apps on the screen, along with a beautiful standard weather app that detects your phone's location and shows the current time and weather in your city.   -Touch is a much better experience on this phone than previous windows mobile phones. The screen is capacitive, meaning it uses touch instead of pressure. No awkward stylus or pushing is needed for the touch to work. The phone responds quickly and smoothly to any motions.   -Basic phone features like placing a call or sending a text remain simple, with big buttons on the main screen to do so.   -Typing on the touchscreen is a breeze due to the size of the screen allowing for a bigger keyboard. As someone who has often stuck to phones with hardware keyboards due to inaccurate screen keyboards, I found typing on the HD2 much easier than previous touchscreen keyboards, although still not as easy as using a hardware keyboard. The HD2 also includes the new SWYPE interface, which lets you type by dragging your fingers through all the letters of a word instead of tapping each one. SWYPE was surprisingly accurate in typing the correct word and will even learn new words once you type them manually.   **Included Apps and Accessories**  -This phone is being marketed as a media phone, and includes several media apps to demonstrate that. MobiTV lets you watch what is essentially Cable TV on your phone free for 30 days and then ten dollars a month after that. Blockbuster lets you rent or buy movies for your phone. Barnes and Noble eReader lets you purchase ebooks.   -The phone comes with a huge 16gb MicroSD card out of the box. This is the biggest memory card available currently, and gives you plenty of room for pictures, videos, music, and apps. The best memory card pairs perfectly with the best processor and screen, and it's great that HTC did not hold back on this extra.   -Full videos of Transformers 1 and 2 are preloaded on the memory card. These videos look great and show off the beautiful screen. Note the movies do take about 4gb of space on the memory card.   -The phone comes with a gel skin in the box to protect the phone, which you would have to buy separately on most phones.   **Drawbacks**  -Price is the number one concern here. The phone is priced higher than competing smartphones. This price seems justified, however, due to the cutting edge hardware in the HD2. It also comes with some nice accessories you'd have to buy separately from other phones. Upgrade and new customer deals will certainly lower the cost for those buying from T-mobile.   -The app store is another drawback. The good news is that the phone has one, the bad news is it's the smallest of ANY smartphone operating system. As of this review the Windows Marketplace carried less than 1,000 applications, compared to Android at 20,000 apps and iPhone at a staggering 150,000 apps. Even Blackberry, Palm, and Nokia carry more apps than Windows. You are also going to find significantly more paid than free applications for Windows Mobile apps. The Marketplace is simply far behind that of competing phones, which for a heavy app user will diminish the enjoyment of the HD2 by quite a bit.   -Windows Mobile 7 upgradeability is still up in the air, but it currently looks like this phone will NOT be getting an upgrade when the new OS is released. The phone does not support some key hardware feature (front buttons) that WM7 requires, and therefore it is unlikely to be upgraded. The upcoming OS promises to be very exciting, and the fact that this beautiful phone will probably not receive the upgrade is disappointing.   Overall this phone is fast, pretty, and offers top of the line features. The phone feels solid (and huge) in your hand, while the software is fast, works well and is fun to use. If the HD2 is any indicator, Windows Mobile may become a legitimate competitor in the smartphone market again. The phone seems to be selling very well, with T-mobile selling out almost everywhere the day the HD2 was released.  I'd recommend this phone as a viable alternative to Android and the iPhone.
like	0	I did not think I needed yet another remote control because I thought the six-axis had everything it needed for movie playing on the PS3 and, yet, I bought one. There were 2 initial reasons:  - my wife was missing a 'magic wand' shaped remote for playing movies - Amazon had it at a great price in one of them lightning deals  I ended up using it myself and, in fact, using it for more than just movie playing - see below.  But, let's do a quick inventory of features:  = It's blue-tooth enabled and, therefore, it's not taking any ports on your PS3. This is probably important for anyone who has a "2-USB ports console". = It's wand-shaped, allowing the non-gamers to control their movie-watching activities while holding a familiar-shaped device in their hand. = It maps ALL the six-axis buttons and performs everything a six-axis would do, except for the joystick features of R3 and L3 (but you do have the push-down or 'click' abilities for them). = 2 AA battery powered (still with the original Sony batteries after 4 months of use) = Includes additional buttons that the movie-only users would expect on a remote such as:  + a number pad  + eject  + red, green, blue, yellow buttons  + play, stop, pause  + slow(step), scan(left/right), prev/next  + display, top menu, pop up menu, return  + subtitles, angle, audio   What is interesting about this remote is that you can use it for much more than movie-playing. Given that it has all the six-axis buttons, guess what? You can use it, and I do use it to:  - surf the web - play music - shop at the PSN store - play certain games such as Sudoku - turn the PS3 on/off when your six-axis controllers are in the charger and I am playing GT5 that is using a racing wheel  And, yes, you CAN turn the PS3 on and off with this remote. Turning it on is easy - you simply press the PlayStation button and the PS3 turns itself on. To turn it off, you either go as far to the left on the X-bar and all the way up and press Enter (the turn-off PlayStation icon will be highlighted) or you simply hold the PlayStation button pressed for a few seconds and then select 'yes' and press the X button a couple of times.  Overall: I am happy with this peripheral. Yes, it's one more remote control but it's a pretty good one, for the reasons I stated above.  _______________________________  Notes - Aug 29, 2009, after 16 months of use  I find that I'm using the remote more and more, not only for playing movies but for navigating the XMB and at the PSN Store, also when playing music or slideshows. Due to its very convenient arrows wheel with an 'enter' button in the middle, navigating the PS3 and doing just about anything other than playing games is a lot easier than using the PS3 game controller. Unlike the controller which normally requires two hands to hold, this is basically a one-hand operation where you hold the remote in one hand and operate the wheel with your thumb. And because it's Bluetooth, not IR (Infrared), you don't even need to point it at the PS3.  And, one word on battery life. After about 15-16 months of operation, this is probably the third set of batteries so I'd estimate battery life to be about 4-6 months. Not too bad.

But my reaction to this book went BEYOND dislike, and I felt I had to vent about it a little bit to get it out of my system.   This book was horrible. Absolutely horrible. I bought it because it was featured in a magazine I read, and I'd heard good things about it, so I decided to give it a try...as a die-hard fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and fantasy literature in general, I thought it was right up my alley. I was wrong.  First of all, I was *disgusted* by the main characters. I actually think one can dislike a character and still like the book/writing, but in this case, the main characters were pathetic and boring. The female lead (Bella Swan. Really. Bella Swan. Why not just call her Pretty McPerfect and have done with it?) is completely vapid. She has no goals, no dreams, no ambition, no personality aside from being miserable and obsessed with her boyfriend. Now, ok, it's romance. Fine. But romance can be accomplished...and often in a better way...if the participants have strong, defining character traits. It heightens the tension and makes the results much more satisfying. Bella had no defining character traits. I don't even remember what she was supposed to look like. She was selfish and misanthropic for absolutely no reason, and she acted like a spoiled martyr for far too many pages. It's really quite depressing that this book is being touted for teenage girls, because the main character is a HORRIBLE role model in every sense of the word. Why not portray her as having goals? Dreams? Ambitions? It would serve to heighten the conflict and make the book better in the long run.  But anyway. The love interest, superhot vampire Edward, is downright scary. And not in like...the good way. He stalks her. He makes decisions for her. He doesn't listen to her views or opinions (not that she has any, really). He encourages her to lie. He puts her in danger...no matter how many times he whines about the emotional toll it puts on him, he still doesn't stop putting her in danger. He is cruel and arrogant. AND SHE ACCEPTS THIS! He keeps telling her how she needs him to look after her, how she would die or something if it wasn't for him. AND SHE IS NOT OFFENDED/ANNOYED BY THIS. Seriously! Even the most ambivalent feminist should find this insulting and derogatory!   There's absolutely no chemistry between the leads. She loves him because he is beautiful. He loves her because he wants to eat her and she smells good. Really. He tells her she is like his heroin. How is that in anyway healthy? She is willing to die for someone she barely knows, someone who plays mind games with her, who dominates her completely. She admits to being completely obsessed with him. And there are no consequences for this! She has no doubts about her emotions toward him!  Ugh. I could go on, but I won't. I just want to say that this is probably the worst book I have ever read, and I'm not too far removed from the teen audience this book is geared to. I see no redeeming features at ALL, except perhaps the character Jacob, who seems like the only person in this entire book that has any interesting and healthy character traits. But now that I've gotten this out of my system, I do feel better.   In short...please don't read this book. Please.

Somehow, the novelty wore off, and the cleverness disappeared. Was it just filler? Were they burnt out and wanting out of their contract? Instead of getting better a lot of bits were so poor in comparison. While watching this season I felt embarrassed for the comedians I normally enjoy.   Looking into the dead eyes of the main stars, it seems like they sold their soul for a longer contract. And when they lost that they also lost their ability to be funny and clever.

I really liked all of the characters.  They completely seemed real to me.  I kept thinking of Sylvie, the mom, and relating her to my mom.  And how my mom is always there backing up my dad and how if my dad was unfaithful I could see the next series of events unfolding the same way they did in the book.  I could also relate to a little bit of something in each of the sisters.  They were both so different and started off so far apart emotionally but grew towards each other.  I thought the plot seemed very realistic.  And I loved the little pop culture/current events tidbits that were in the story.  Some are so recent that I think its incredible that they're in the book.  And I think that some women might not like the ending with Sylvie, but I did.  Without giving away what happens, I think I would have made the same choice that she did.  A great summer read!

I've had it for almost a year and I use it all the time (when the weather is chilly). The material is thin, and it looks cheap. I was not impressed with it when I first saw it, but after using it I discovered that even though it is thin, it's still really warm. I have washed it many times and it is still in great condition. It's soft and my dog really likes snuggling with me when I use it.   The other day we went to Petsmart and discovered the dog Snuggie. Of course my boyfriend had to get it. It was supposed to be another joke. Me and my dog with matching Snuggies! I honestly did not expect my dog to wear it, but he really loves it too. He won't let me take it off. The box is really funny. There is a picture of a dog relaxing on the couch with his remote control and another picture of a couple of dogs playing backgammon. (I'm easily ammused, I suppose)  In summary, it started out as a joke. The Snuggie has provided me with lots of laughs. But more importantly, I love my Snuggie because it does what it says it will do - it keeps me warm and comfortable, and yet, my hands are free!

Much easier than handing him one piece at a time! The tray wiped clean very easily. There were some crumbs in the corners, but we just shook them out into the trash. It was also good for small toys and books. I like that it is made out of a soft, but durable material, which makes it safe in case of a car accident. The material feels like the padded shoulder straps of a backpack. It is lightweight, and my son didn't seem to mind it. He even fell asleep with the tray in place. This tray will go with us on every car trip in the future!

It depth and breadth are staggering, as it follows its protagonist, Pip, from his early childhood through his later life. During the course of his life, we encounter a vast catalog of raw human emotions:  love, hate, jealousy, hope, sadness, despair, anger, pity, empathy, sympathy -- and on and on. The story is treasured and revered for many reasons. One of its main strengths is its plot:  after a somewhat slow introductory section, Dickens puts his story in fifth gear and delivers a fast-paced and exciting story that gallops along without ever losing interest or clarity. The incredibly complex plotline, full of separate stories and incidents that seem totally unrelated to each other, but are then all harnessed together as the book heads straight toward its denouement, is also full of constant plot twists, which continue up until, literally, the last paragraph. But, of course, as with all of Dickens's major works, it is the characters that make the book. Like Shakespeare, Dickens preferred to have the story develop through the characters, rather than having the characters be mere set pieces inside of an overriding story. And what great characters they are:  the perennially paradoxical but essentially human Pip; the bitter and mysterious Miss Havisham; the beautiful and haughty Estella; the simple and saint-like Joe; the kind and benevolent Herbert; the very human convict, Magwitch -- and all of the other wonderful characters. Dickens excelled in creating well-rounded, very human characters who harbored very real and very complex emotions -- that is, human emotions. We identify with Pip as he winds through his life, because we have been there, too -- the disappointments, the surprises, the loves, the anger, the sadness. In whatever way his story may differ from our own, it is still essentially human, as is ours. For all of his complex and paradoxical emotions and sentiments, Pip is a recognizably human character -- and that is why we love him and this book. A masterpiece for the ages, which will endure for years yet to come, Great Expectations is a great book that can be loved by one and all, for, at its heart, is that grain of simple truth that says so much about what is human in all of us -- whether we have great expectations or not.

People looking for subwoofers usually already have a decent system, but know that there is something lacking.  When it came for me to buy one, three factors weighed in my decision: power, brand, and (of course) price.  I've grown up with what I have always believed to be a 'healthy skepticism' when it comes to Sony products.  My father had an early generation (1990ish) 5.0 Sony 250 Watt surround amp that performed extremely poorly in just about every function.  The only advantage it had over his earlier (1978) Rotel non-tube amp is that it had multiple component inputs.  The sound quality of the 50 Watt rated Rotel amp blew the Sony out of the water.  In my search for a subwoofer, I was surprised to find so many good reviews of the Sony line.  I was looking for a better name than Sony, but when I compared prices, I was compelled to give the Sony at least a listen.  Comparable subs by Velodyne and others were far more expensive (double the cost of the Sony or more).  Listening to the Sony at the stereo shop, I must say that I was extremely impressed.    Is the Sony sound as good as the Velodyne or other high end subwoofers that cost 2-3 times as much as the Sony?  Of course not, but I quickly discovered that difference in sound quality was not at all closely related to the difference in price.  Keep in mind that this is one of Sony's smallest and lightest subs (only 25 lbs), but once I brought it home and hooked it up to my 6.1 surround system and configured the frequency and volume on the back of the sub, it seamlessly expanded the low end range of my system for music and movie playback.  Before I learned (by experimenting with them) how to adjust the levels on the back of the sub, it was quite boomy and there was a bit of a gap between the low end on the six surround speakers and where the sub picked up.  When I made the appropriate adjustments, by trial and error, I found that this sub is an extremely versatile fit for my home.  My family room is 17'x14', and the back opens into a 10'x15' living room, and the sub easily fills the room.  When I crank the system for rock and roll music and movies, the sub has no problem keeping up and is easily capable of playing more loudly than is safe or enjoyable.  Would I have liked a bigger sub made by a better brand?  Sure, but this one does the job (and then some) admirably, and for less than half the cost.  This sub gets 4 stars as a product, but I gave it 5 because of the extremely good value.  If you have a big budget and can afford to spend what it would take to buy a speaker that actually sounds better than one of these Sony subs, go for it, you will not be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you would rather spend less on a sub and still get excellent power and sound quality, this is as good as it gets without spending several hundred dollars.

I have NEVER paid for than about $12-13 for it, and the inserts used to be available from WalMart for 3/$9.  The catnip helps get the attention for the scratching part, and once the see how much fun it is to scratch, they rarely go back to carpet or furniture.  I've had more than one cat that never ONCE went for furniture because I made sure he/she had her own turbo-scratcher from the moment they arrived in my house.  I have one that is a light blue from back in the 80s when everything was light blue and mauve.  If left in the sun a bit too long, they do tend to get a little brittle, but while they feel a little flimsy, they are perfect for the cats.  For those without carpet -- use the rubber shelf or drawer liner cut in a square or circle a couple of inches bigger than the whole toy and it doesn't move at all.  I have never had any problem on any surface until I recently moved into a house with handscraped hardwood floors that are uneven.  This trick worked wonders there and I suspect it would have been more stable on the tile floor in our last house as well, but our cat like to sleep on it in the window in the sun just as much as playing or scratching it.  I recommend one to any cat that I adopt out at rescue, and for my foster babies, I give one to the family that adopts them because that's what I teach them to scratch on and I don't want them developing bad habits of scratching furniture or carpet in their new home -- where they are often trying to cope with the unfamiliar.  I've been told by my adoptive families that this was a really great thing to send esp since it was familiar and they were surprised at how much it was used.  Before replacing the cardboard circle, make sure you turn it over and use both sides!  if they seem a little bored and you are out of catnip, just pic up a little bag of it and it will totally get their attention again.

This isn't that similar to tinned haggis in Scotland; mainly the texture of tinned haggis back home is finer and drier than this...but it is fairly close to the 'real' haggis in a skin and is spiced just perfectly. I think preparation counts for a lot with this haggis and I dry fry it in a pan whilst stirring it until it just starts to brown as I think that improves the texture. All in all it's great with a baked potato or just for fellow Scots missing a taste of home. If you haven't tried haggis then this is a great example of how good it is...and it really is like nothing else!

There's also a detachable visor that snaps on the front. I use it for when I ride my moped and if I tilt my head down, it cuts the wind so it's not blowing as much in my eyes and face. It's very comfortable and not too heavy. It fits perfectly in the storage compartment under my moped seat, which is great if you don't want it to get stolen or have to carry it wherever you're going.

Since I was strictly informed not to get any chick-flicks, I figured this was the best choice.  It is based on a true story about a guy named Beauford Pusser (gross name) who after comming home from the millitary notices a great deal of change in his home town. The mill he and his father once worked at is now closed and the main source of income for this small town is the casino/strip club owned by his former friend.  Things turn ugly whe Chris Vaughn (The Rock) notice the casino is cheating their customers.  He tries to go to the police and they are just as crooked as the casino, so the Rock takes matters into his own hands.  Great movie choice for ladies wanting to please their boyfriend with a non-chickflick. But don't worry ladies even if you don't like the story line, you will still enjoy it, because the Rock is very nice to look at!! Enjoy.

But somehow the story did not captivate me as much as the first Lisbeth Salander / Mikael Blomkvist book. And here are my main points of criticism:  1. There is no direct interaction between Lisbeth and Mikael in this story. They are connected by the events, yes, but the unique relationship that had begun to develop between them in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was not continued here, and for me this was a key element and one of the main reasons I was so fascinated with the characters. With every page I turned (and there are many!), I was hoping to see them come together again, alas it only happened at the very end of the book and even then there was no communication between the two.  2. The storyline - to me - was much less believable than in the first book. There are a few (for lack of a better word) improbabilities here that almost ruined it for me. Especially the scene towards the end, where Lisbeth is confronted with her brother and her father and their unspeakable act against her (I don't want to give anything away, so no details but you will know what I mean when you get to it). The coherence I so admired in the first book was just not that well executed in The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage) .  3. The end came extremely abruptly. I actually went online after finishing it to make sure that I hadn't somehow received an issue with some of the pages missing. I just couldn't believe that this book with several hundred pages and tons of details given on those would simply end like this. But it did and left me shaking my head a bit.  In summary, this is not a bad thriller but it did not reach the masterful craftsmanship and effortlessness that made the first book an absolute standout in the ocean of thrillers on the market.  
like	0	I think 'Brown Sugar' is a film that had a lot of potential with all the characterizations in it but failed to deliver as a blockbuster. For example, the movie tries (way too hard) to take you "back in the day" with the birth of Hip Hop. That is fine but for the one millionth and one time: How many times will Sanaa or Taye Diggs say 'Hip Hop'? We get the point. The soundtrack could have been more documentary with Hip Hop/ Neo-Soul music from the 1980s to 2000s.   Another the thing that I could not stand is the illecit love affair between Sanaa (Sydney) & Taye Diggs (Dre) characters, after Dre got MARRIED. It would have been nice to see them turn their friendship into a more than plutonic level, even after he proposed to Nicole Ari Parker's character. Afterall, she wasn't really in love with him in the first place, and he had made a rush of judgement. But sadly, he gets married and then Taye Diggs falls in love with his best friend. What about his wife?  Finally, it would have been nice to see the Hip Hop Industry's B-Side present challenges that challenged their friendship. It was like a smooth ride love story with a twist of adultery, and the ending was too obvious. With a good romance, who cares about an obvious ending but at least give me some plots and intrigue and a reason to watch the film several more times. The ending made me shake my head! And with all the potential, this film did not deliver mainly because of adulterous themes and an annoying focus on 'Hip Hop'.

I've always been fairly inactive and now that I'm in my mid-40s, it's been starting to cause an overall lack of stamina and back pain and exhaustion from walking short distances (and I'm not even overweight). But after just 2 weeks of Wii Fit Plus (usually 30 -45 minutes per day), I'm really noticing a difference. I'm thrilled!  You can work up a sweat without even noticing because you're having so much fun. The Island Cycling is my favorite (love the Island View Course). It definitely gets your blood pumping. Some of my other favorites include Rhythm Kung Fu, Advanced Step, Hula Hoop, Obstacle Course, Rhythm Parade, Bull's Eye, Jogging and Boxing. There are so many choices that it's hard to imagine anyone not finding something that's fun for them or that suits their needs and goals (unless they're already in great shape).  Some of the activities can be a bit challenging to get the hang of (and it seems that different people have trouble with different things). I'm disastrous at skateboarding, but I'm a "calorie torcher" at obstacle course. My boyfriend's 12-year-old son got quickly frustrated with the obstacle course, but I bet he'd be a natural at skateboarding. You just have to find what works for you. Fortunately there are plenty of choices!  Another fun feature is that you feel like you're working out with your friends and family. As your family members add themselves to the program (and you can also add your pets), they are featured throughout the game. Your regular Wii friends are featured too, but not as prominently. They cheer you on at the finish line, demonstrate the moves, toss you your hula hoops, march in your band, etc., and your pet can run along side you as you cycle. It can be an added little boost to your workout. Wii Fit Plus also keeps track of your best times/scores, so it's fun to be able to challenge your previous records. It always feel great when you beat your previous best.  The yoga is good if you like a more calm, relaxed type of workout. Personally I have a hard time staying away from the more active games, but I'm glad it's there when I want to work on strength. 
like	0	It seems the main reason Dr. Peter Lillback calls George Washington a Christian,and not a Deist is because he believed in Divine Providence,or the belief that God is active in peoples lives. When we think of Divine Providence we think of the word Theism, and all the Abrahamic faiths that claim God personally spoke to key individuals called Prophets in the form of personal revelations.  Understandably as words do change (proving that the written word is not a good vehicle for the "word of God") from their original meaning, Mr.Lillback confuses the word Deist with the word Atheist (non-Theist) which really is the opposite of Theist.    In todays world the word Atheist for the most part implies that there is no God.  The word Atheist has changed from its original meaning,but we know that whenever you add an "a" in front of a word it means the opposite,so its the Atheist that believes in a inactive God,and not a Deist.  The word Deist is derived from the word Deism that is derived from the word Deity which is simply the Latin word for God. A Deist is just someone who believes that God is,and the word Deism just implies a path of understanding.   George Washington IMO was a Deist who was a Theist who followed the path called Deism.  He believed in God,he thought that God was active in his life,and he knew to look towards the Creation (the product that comes from God) to gain true insight.  Since Mr. Lillback uses Thomas Paine for an example of a Deist we should at least take Thomas Paine's definition on who,or what a Deist is,and what a true Deist believe.    "Every person, of whatever religious denomination he may be, is a DEIST in the first article of his Creed. Deism, from the Latin word Deus, God, is the belief of a God, and this belief is the first article of every man's creed.  It is on this article, universally consented to by all mankind, that the Deist builds his church, and here he rests. Whenever we step aside from this article, by mixing it with articles of human invention, we wander into a labyrinth of uncertainty and fable, and become exposed to every kind of imposition by pretenders to revelation"  Thomas Paine thought that anyone who believes in God was a Deist (including all Christians) in the first article of his creed, which is the belief in a God.   Mr. Lillback states in his book that Thomas Paine was a "hard Deist".  "Hard Deist", apparently a new title that Mr. Lillback says he made up to describe a Deist that doesn't believe in Divine Providence,or again the belief in the God that went away,and no longer intervenes in mans affairs. Again a "Hard Deist" if we must use the phrase describes what an Atheist would think,and not what a pure Deist would think.  Dr. Peter Lillback either never read Thomas Paines works,or he's out right lying about Thomas Paines character in matters of God. All self professed Deists in our founding fathers day believed in Divine Providence even Thomas Paine. So "Hard Deist",or even Atheist would not apply to Mr. Paine because Thomas Paine was a Deist (he believed in God) who was a Theist (he believed that God was active in his life) who followed the path called Deism.  In Mr. Lillbacks book he quotes Thomas Paine several times,but he takes his words out of context to make his point clear about who,or what a Deist is,and what a true,or pure Deist really believes about our Maker.  Before I quote some key phrases from Thomas Paine that clearly prove that he, like George Washington believed in "Divine Providence" I ask the reader to examine   "A Discourse At The Society Of Theophilanthropists"  This was a Theistic church that Thomas Paine was a key founder. Proving that Mr. Paine believed in an active God right up till the end of his life.  Thomas Paine called God "the Almighty lecturer".  God had something to say to Thomas Paine,and luckily for us he wrote most of it down in all his Theological writings.   "The Almighty Lecturer, by displaying the principles of science in the  structure of the universe, has invited man to study and imitation. It is as if He said to the  inhabitants of this globe, that we call ours, 'I have made an earth for man to dwell upon,  and I have rendered the starry heavens visible, to teach him science and the arts. He  can now provide for his own comfort, and learn from my munificence to all, to be kind to  each other.' "   "The world has been amused with the term revealed religion, and the generality of priests apply this term to the books called the Old and New Testament. The Mahometans apply the same term to the Koran. There is no man that believes in revealed religion stronger than I do; but it is not the reveries of the Old and New Testament, nor the Koran, that I dignify with that sacred title. That which is revelation to me, exists in something which no human mind can invent, no human hand can counterfeit or alter. The Word of God is the Creation we behold; and this Word of God revealeth to man all that is necessary for man to know of his Creator."  Mr. Lillback is using his own definition of what a Deist is to prove that George Washington wasn't a Deist,and his definition is wrong. Instead of making up your own definition of these words (Deist,or Deism) to prove your point why not get the correct definition from those who actually claim to be true,or pure Deists?  Most (not all) of todays self professed Deists of today like days of old will tell you that they believe in a active God.   Did George Washington believe that our Creator overshadowed a young virgin girl who was engaged to be married to save us from the sins of the world,and all the mythologies that would also need to be believed as fact to prove this absurdity?    George Washington was enlightened enough to know mythologies from reality.  Lets not taint this great mans legacy by saying he believed the Bible as an absolute literal truth just because you do Mr. Lillback.  This book IMO in no way proves George Washington was a true Christian.  Like they did with the man called Jesus years after his death making him into something he was not Dr. Peter Lillback does this with our great American hero George Washington. Turning,or perverting true 'history" into his story,and twisting reality in the process.  People who look for truth will know the difference.  Mr.Lillback, we're all Deists who believe that God is.  Where we differ is our path of understanding. If you want to learn all about the faiths of our ancestors then the Bible,Koran,and the like are a great place to gain insight, however if you want to learn about God then you must look towards the Creation,or all the products that come from God. I think George Washington knew this truth as he was surrounded by other enlightened "pure" Deists.  Mr. Washington knew that books prove that man is real,and the Creation proves that God is real.   This book will look great next to the other fat book in the evangelical library.  Remember just because a book is thick,and fat doesn't make it fact.
like	0	Simple Plan's second original CD, "Still Not Getting Any . . . " gives its legion of fans no letdown after the long wait for the second CD.  If anything, it is an improvement on the first.    Fans at their shows have already been introduced to "Welcome to My Life" and "Shut Up!", both good, catchy songs just packed with the adolescent angst that is SP's trademark.  "Shut Up!" in particular, shows the band's knack for combining downbeat lyrics with upbeat tunes, in a song which I interpret as a teenager's thoughts while being lectured by his parents.    Something's changed a bit from the first CD, and that's the band's perspective.  Many of the songs on "No Pads, No Helmets, . . . Just Balls" had the perspective of a teen complaining about a poor relationship with a parent.  There's still a bit of that in songs like "Me Against The World" and "Shut Up!", but this time, more songs talk about a romantic relationship gone bad (for example, "Perfect World", "Everytime" and "Thank You"), and the perspective is more young adult than teenager--"Everytime" talks about the partner waking the singer at 3 a.m. and driving to dawn--not likely if still living at home.  The band's characters are maturing, as is their music.    Other notable songs include "Crazy", a throwback to Reset's (the predecessor band to Simple Plan) socially-conscious songs, and "Jump", plainly intended as a concert song but very strong in its own right.    Perhaps the strongest song on the CD is "Untitled", a downbeat song with downbeat music, the dying thought of someone who doesn't know why he's dying, and despite the people around him, is dying utterly alone.  The sadness which runs through many of the band's works is here in full strength.  Softer than usual and using a piano (shades of "Meet You There" on the first CD), even if never released as a single, it may well be the band's best song to date.    While lead singer Pierre Bouvier did almost all the singing on the first CD, much more is heard from backup singers Sebastien Lefebvre and David Derosiers do a lot more of the singing here, and they are well worth listening to.    Extras on the DVD or flip side (depending on edition) include the video for "Welcome to My Life" and the program (shown, I believe, on MTV) about its making.  Highly, highly recommended.

So many of us stuck with this show for 6 years from day one, and will always hold a special place in our hearts ... It would have been impossible to end something like that with everyone satisfied. It may be "over" but I know at least for me, I'll be thinking about this show for a lifetime.

Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has comments on several interesting things.  Affleck's commentary is sometimes very funny.  The other commentary track features the Director of Photography and special effects people. The commentary includes interesting details, including background information on the characters and filming locations.  Note:  The commentary is raw and sometimes laced with profanity, although the movie itself is rated PG-13, for reasons explained in the commentary.   Although it's not much, this collection is also a Director's Cut and has a couple scenes added, notable of which is Harry Stamper's character visiting his father before launch.  Some other scenes are cut slightly differently, adding some depth to the story. The Gag reel on the second disk is extremely funny, raw, and not your typical &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; documentary. The second disk also features a tremendous amount of information on the special effects and includes many different trailers and promo material.  The Aerosmith song video is also included. While the story can be nit-picked, it's still very exciting and enjoyable.  Overall, if you liked the movie, the Criterion Collection release is the DVD to have.

I especially like that it is small and it charges my Nano as well as plays it.  The sound is not your big bold booming stereo sound, but not bad for a little set of speakers.  Will work for me and what I'm needing it for, and  I'm ordering 2 more for my grandsons' Nanos as well.

While healthcare needs reform in the US, pointing to healthcare systems in other countries where their citizens come to the US for care if they can afford the cost is ridiculous.  Anyone that's followed Michael Moore's work has learned to expect a certain amount of exaggeration in his films, but Sicko sets a new high bar for him.  Net-Net: entertaining fiction presented as truth.

As a happy Verizon customer, however, I was not going to switch providers just to get a new phone (although the thought crossed my mind more than once!). After a long wait, I finally got my hands on an iPhone competitor, the Motorola Droid. While it might not be the "iPhone Killer" that people have claimed it to be, it's a great phone in its own right.  CALL QUALITY For some reason, I get fewer service bars/seemingly weaker reception compared to my LG Dare. In the same spot, holding both phones, I get 5 bars on my Dare (which I've since given ), while I only get 2 bars on my Droid. Weird, but fortunately I haven't actually noticed any decline in call quality or reliability; it's been superb!  SPEAKER Loud, and good quality! This is important, because whether you're listening for driving directions using the built-in GPS, streaming music through Pandora, or talking, the speaker is very loud and clear.  BATTERY LIFE Decent. Yes, the battery can run out quickly, but that's just because you'll find yourself using the phone so much! Some of the biggest battery drainers I've noticed have been screen brightness, GPS, and streaming radio. These problems can be resolved by turning down screen brightness (even at its lowest setting, still bright and crisp), turning off the GPS when it's not in use (through the Power Control widget), and not relying exclusively on streaming radio for music (with the included 16GB card you can store plenty!)  DISPLAY Gorgeous, crisp, and very bright display that makes other phones pale in comparison. I love it, and highly recommend those considering this phone to take a look at one in their local Verizon store. Even at its darkest setting, its very good. The high-resolution display also allows for text to appear much more detailed and crisp, a plus for those with glasses.  CAMERA The Droid packs a 5 Megapixel camera, as well as video-recording at roughly DVD-quality. The camera is a bit slow to auto-focus, but pictures come out fine. Not great, but decent for a cell phone, especially at night using the flash. While its still pictures don't come out great, the Droid's videos come out really well. The audio recorded on videos is also really good.  LOOK AND FEEL The phone isn't light, but it also isn't as heavy as I feared based on initial reviews. The only criticism is that there are no dedicated call/end buttons...instead, you have to rely on the phone application, which means you can't feel around for the call/end buttons, say you get a phone call in the middle of the night. Still, that's just a minor gripe. The phone feels sturdy, not cheap, and is pretty slim considering it packs a full slide-out QWERTY keyboard.  KEYBOARD One of the major selling points of this phone was that it has a physical keyboard. The keyboard isn't perfect - keys are shallow, too close to one another, and there isn't a dedicated row for numbers. Also, the top row of keys is inconveniently located too high to the top of the phone. Still, despite these shortcomings, I would not use this phone without the physical keyboard. After a year with the touchscreen-only LG Dare, I still had difficulty with typing, and even after 2 years with an iPod Touch - which has a much better touchscreen keyboard than the Dare - I have difficulty with typing on that, as well. While the touchscreen keyboard on the Droid is very good, I still make many fewer mistakes with the physical keyboard than with the touchscreen one. While I'd say this is largely a matter of personal preference, I'd like to emphasize that the physical keyboard isn't nearly as bad as some reviewers online made it out to be.  Android Market As it stands now, the Android Market has over 10,000 apps, while the Apple App store has over 100,000. As a result, some reviewers have said - wrongly, I believe - that the Droid is somehow more limited. One should remember that while the iPhone/Touch had a headstart in developing its application market, many new developers have flocked to Android as more phones have come to market. There already is a strong selection of apps, and this will only grow over time.  SHORTCOMINGS The two major shortcomings of this phone - especially when compared to the iPhone - are that: 1. Not as intuitive as the iPhone. I think this phone is great for many users, but others might find it to be a little complicated. This phone is very capable, but sometimes to find things you have to dig around a bit more than might be convenient (I don't mind this too much). 2. No widespread and easily available alternative to iTunes. I use DoubleTwist, but without a doubt iTunes is a much easier way to transfer media to the phone than dragging and dropping or using iTunes alternatives, for most people at least. While I don't buy MP3s online, others have also pointed to the iTunes store offering much more selection than Amazon's MP3 store.  CONCLUSIONS Who should get this phone? If this is your first smartphone, you might find things to be a little difficult at first, but well worth the patience. While this phone isn't for everybody, if you are already on/hope to switch to Verizon, this is without a doubt one of the strongest offerings. I don't know if I would necessarily dump my iPhone if I were an AT&T Customer, but I think that this phone will be a very useful tool for many people who have considered an iPhone but wanted a physical keyboard, more customizability, or more Google integration. While there are a few shortcomings in design and media integration, I can now say I've found the cure to my iPhone envy!   **UPDATE 2.22.10**  I wanted to say that while I'm still very happy with my Droid, one problem has arisen. For some reason, text messages I compose are not always going through...after minutes of trying, the phone simply notifies me saying that the text message was not sent. I have no clue why this is happening, but must say it is a bit frustrating. Fortunately, it doesn't happen too often, but it has happened enough to notice. This has happened to text messages I've sent to people on different carriers, so I'm assuming the problem is from my end on not the recipients'. Either way, a small price to pay for an otherwise amazing phone.

If you're like me, you use your beard trimmer when you don't have much time in the morning before you have to take off for work. If you trim with this thing quickly on the 'normal' trimming mode, it'll catch maybe 75% of your hair in the vaccuum. However, when you enter warp speed (turbo mode) this thing is insane. It's really loud and sounds like it might explode, but it works great. It catches roughly 90-95% of hair in the vacuum in turbo mode. It's quite easy to take apart to empty out the little hair-catch-all and clean trimmer attachments or swapping them out (comes with a fine-line trimmer). The height adjustment doesn't seem quite as pronounced as my older Norelco trimmer (meaning you can obviously tell when it clicks into place...this one not so much) but it works nonetheless. I'm happy with it and recommend it to all who read this. Just be sure to take a minute out of your abnormally busy day to read the instructions and precautions and maintenance tips to prolong the life of this thing. That's what they're there for, after all.

He's so hot when he's wet!" was the first thing I heard from the squealing 13 year old girl seated next to me as this movie started in the theater, and yes, Percy Jackson (the son of Poseidon) was frequently wet throughout this movie.  I also heard other variations on this exclamation, ranging from "He's so hot when he sweats" to "He's even hot when he bleeds!" and although I agreed wholeheartedly with the young lady to my left, this movie has a lot more going for it than the fantastic eye candy that is Logan Lerman.  The movie is a great adventure filled with plenty of suspense and cleaver and funny dialogue.  It also includes one of my favorite scenes in a movie released within the last five years, which I will only describe with the words "Poker Face" so as not to spoil it for any new viewers.    Yes, there are a several over-the-top or wooden performances from a few of the adult actors (Pierce Brosnan, coming off as more of a creepy child molester than the Dumbledore-like figure of wisdom and guidance he hopes to be) but the young actors playing Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Luke were fantastic in their roles.    This movie was so much fun; I wound up seeing it 4 times in the theater with a friend of mine who also fell in love with it.  I had never read the books before, but I am grateful to this movie for inspiring me to read the Percy Jackson series, which is better quality than the film.  However, as far as entertainment value goes, you can't beat this movie.

It's a cutting edge stroller and the price tag shows it. I have a 2 month old and a 17m old... it's perfect for us! Thanks Baby Jogger for yet another great product!  Update: 2.5 months later- still LOVING my stroller! I have both seats, and the car seat adapter. Love, love, love it. It's the most expensive baby product we own and it should be- I use it the most. I wanted a stroller that would allow me to bust out of the house with two babies or just one baby if needed... this did it. I don't need two strollers anymore! By the way, our boys are huge and this stroller holds them well. Our 18 month old is 30 pounds and the 3 month old is 16 pounds... still trucks along like nothing!
like	0	There seems to be a lack of reviews online for the new Sony 560 and Panasonic 80 Blu-ray players. So I purchased both of these Blu-ray players from Amazon, mainly becuase I wanted to do a critical, side by side comparison of all features and the audio and video quality. It wasn't a professional test-based comparison, just flipping back and forth between these players and my Samsung BD-UP5000 Blu-ray/HD DVD player on my Sony 52" Bravia LCD and studying the image with a critical eye. (I got 3 copies of the Braveheart Blu-ray to do this). Here's what I discovered:  Video Quality: Pretty much a dead tie. Both players had rich, dark blacks. Video noise (smoothness) of the pictures was so close that I couldn't tell which I was watching most of the time. Sharpness was the same. Both pictures had good "3D pop". I wouldn't be surprised if both players used the same chipset. (By the way, the Samsung uses the Reon HQV chip, and while it looked a bit "smoother" by comparison, a tiny bit of the sharpness and detail shown on the Sony and Panasonic was missing on the Samsung. Also the Samsung has a very slight cyan cast to the blacks and the overall picture.)  Audio Quality: I think the Panasonic wins here, but only by a slim margin. Panasonic touts this player as a "high clarity audio" Blu-ray player and it does sound sweet through my Onkyo TS-SR805 receiver, on my Paradigm Monitor 11 speakers. Again, this conclusion is based only on the DolbyHD sountrack on the Braveheart Blu-ray. I'm going to do more serious listening, but I think the Panasonic will still prove better, audio-wise, with any source material.  Audio Formats: Both of these players will Bitstream or PCM output the new HD audio formats. This means that if your receiver doesn't decode them, the player will. Or vice-versa. Some people say pre-amps/receivers do a better job at decoding than BD players do, but I guess that depends on your gear. The Panasonic DMP-BD80 sure sounds good, and I couldn't hear a decoding difference between it or my receiver. With the Sony, I think the receiver may have sounded a touch better, but that might have been in my head.  Speed and Handling: No question about it, the Sony beats the Panasonic hands down. This new Panasonic is no faster than last year's model it replaced, the 55. Everything about the Panasonic is slow...load times, react times when buttons are pressed, or when skipping chapters. The Sony 560 is about the same as the PS3. Every cloud has a silver lining, and the Panasonic DOES give you time to make a cup of tea while your disc is loading!  Another little thing about the Panasonic that I don't like is the size (width) of the disc tray...it's the same size or a hair bigger than the disc itself (instead of being smaller like most players) so it's very hard to grab the disc. This sounds like a little niggle, but try it and see. It will drive you nuts every time you try to remove a disc...you'll end up dropping them back onto the tray if you're not extremely careful.  Remote Controls: They're about the same...both very flimsy and cheaply made. Put a gun to my head and I'll say the Panasonic's remote is a little heavier and has larger buttons that are a little better laid out. The Sony 560 is drawing fire for this because it doesn't have an eject/drawer open button on the remote. This is a silly complaint...correct me if I'm wrong, but you almost have to be standing in front of the player to put a disc in or take a disc out anyway, right?!?!?! So what's the big deal about having to press the "open" button on the player? Serious remote-picky people have a Harmony remote anyway.  Other Convenience Features: Neither of these players has Netflix built in, I guess that's a big deal now. Unless they can steam full-quality 1080P (without pauses, subject to my ISP speed) I could care less about that. The reason I have 3 Blu-ray players is because I care about quality and I'm not too cheap to buy Blu-ray movies! The Panasonic has the Amazon/VieraCast and YouTube feature though. Again, I have no desire to see a rough, low-quality mpeg video shot by an idiot on a cell phone on my high def TV! Both of these players are BD 2.0 (BD Live) capable, but only the Sony has Wi-Fi built in. That's a nice feature because you don't have to run a CAT-5 cable from your router to your Blu-ray player. I think the 560 is the first stand alone BD player to have this (the PS3 had it all along). The Panasonic has 7.1 channel analog (RCA) audio outputs, important to people that have older receivers without HDMI. The Sony 560 dropped this feature that used to be on last year's 550 model. Most people have newer, HDMI capable receivers, so I see why they did it. (Sony also did it to make their step-up model, the BDPS1000ES seem more attractive. (That player is $699 and is basically a 560 with a handful of extra features added, like a headphone jack). The Panasonic has an SD card slot on the front, good if you want to view your pictures on your TV, and a USB jack. The Sony features two USB jacks, one on the front and one on the back.  Build Quality: About the same, maybe the Sony wins here by a hair. Both are smallish players, not very deep. The Sony is about 8/10's of an inch taller.  Conclusion: Overall I like the Sony better. It's wireless connectivity is a great feature, and Sony has a great history (with the PS3) of keeping the firmware updated, and this makes it easier. The Panasonic is a nice player, and has slightly better sound, but I'm sticking with the Sony. Anyone wanna buy a slightly used Panasonic DMP-BD80?  (By the way...I had no audio problems whatsoever with the Sony, like some other reviewers had. The Sony has a lot of audio output settings, and I still think some of them had them set wrong. That, or their other gear couldn't handle the output from the 560. I'm seeing a bunch of posts online recently about different TV's and receivers not being compatible or being able to handle certain audio signals, especially bitstream...if your gear doing the decoding doesn't have the "oomph" or processing power to decode it, it will choke and puke!)

like	0	I got my Droid Incredible in the mail on Tuesday even though the release date is today (4/29). The phone is stunning...with all the simplicity you'd expect out of a new smartphone and all the fun you'd expect out of a Google phone.  Pros: Android OS and Sense Customizable Beautiful Screen Android Market 8MP camera (shoots well in low light don't let anyone tell you different) super fast processor 7 home screens that you can view by pinching.  You don't have to swipe through all 7.  Makes my friends jealous. the browser is smooth and fast. Auto aligns text when you zoom.  uses multi-touch to pinch and zoom. Smooth scrolling and fast, fast load times.  Cons hard to sync any e-mail other than a gmail account facebook app sucks, but i just made a bookmark to the full site, since the internet is super fast optical trackpad is glitchy but i only use it for the camera battery life...but Seidio is coming out with an extended battery so thats not going to be a problem soon  Bottom Line: Honestly, I have been waiting for a phone like this every since the iPhone.  I don't have AT&T and to be honest I just don't like Apple as a company.  They make cool stuff, but they rip their customers off.  This phone is an iPhone killer.  Compare them on all levels of performance, looks, functionality, customization, and speed and you'll find that the Droid Incredible is the same if not better.  Also, Verizon's coverage is fantastic, so don't be fooled by 4G.  I'm sure its great if you live somewhere where you get service.  EDIT: (4/30) This phone eats RAM like crazy.  I installed "Advanced Task Killer" but I was still down to only 42M after a few days.  I would suggest downloading either "Task Manager" or "TaskPanel" (I have Task Manager and my boyfriend has TaskPanel on his Moto Droid and both work quite well).  I also suggest restarting the phone every few days just like you would a real computer.  Other than that still no complaints   :)
like	0	Review updated: July 17, 2009  I don't know what to say...this is a great product!  I remember back in the '80s, we had this crude epilator with a curved rubber tube with tiny slits in it that would open up on the bottom and then close as the tube rotated.  Well, it didn't work worth a crap and it hurt like the devil when it did grab a hair.  So a couple decades later and there's finally a epilator that works the way you'd expect it to.  And the greatest thing is, is that it doesn't hurt in the long run.  It'll hurt a bit at the beginning, especially when you're doing thick patches of hair, but subsequent sessions it actually feels good.  Basically the density of the hairy area you're doing, the more it'll hurt.  Think about it...the more hairs you're pulling out at any given time, the more pain you feel...makes sense, right?  But when you're just going afetr a afew strays or the sporatic regrowth, you'll hardly feel it.  Anyway, here's the deal.  Hair grows in cycles.  Not all hair is above the surface at any given time.  So when you epilate and you think you're smooth, don't be suprised when you find new stubble a day or so later.  But don't worry, that's not hair you missed, that's NEW hair.  Because when you pull it out, it's just as long as the other hair that you pulled out before.  And how long is the hair under your skin?  You'd be amazed.  The pieces I measured were typically 5-6 mm long.  And hair typically grows 1 mm per 5-7 days.  So if you do the math, once your skin is totally epilated, (usually over the course of a week), expect the advertised 3-4 weeks of smooth skin.  And the thing is, is that if you epilate every month or so, over time, your hair will become finer and thinner.  You may even experience total hair loss if and when any given follicle gives up producting hair.  EDIT: I haven't found this to be true yet, but who knows...  The epilator drum or roller is very unique.  It contains 40 metal flaps (tweezers) that move against plastic edges which grabs and pulls out the hairs as the drum rotates away from your skin.  It really doesn't take much of a hair above the surface for the tweezers to work either.  That's probably one of the greatest thing about this epilator.  ie. you don't have to wait days for hair to grow to a certain length to epilate them.  You can do it with 24 hours or so.    This epilator comes with several different heads and attachements.  It comes with the epilator head with two snap-on attachements that supposedly alleviate the pain for new users.  I found out that the one with the rollers wasn't really necessary.  The advanced user head makes you use the epilator at a 90 degree angle from your skin.  It also helps keep the RPM at a high rate.  But it hinders fine placement in those hard to get areas.  At which point, it's just as well if you don't use an attachment and go with the bare drum.  The other head is a oscilating razor with foil grill as seen in many other razors of this sort these days.  However, being a Braum product, it works really well.  The razor also has a leading trimmer for those long hairs that won't go into the foil.  There's also an attachment that supposedly cuts long hair at the preferred length for optimal epilation.       The spotlight on the on/off switch is excellent.  It's one of those little LED bulbs that are used in those multi-LED flashlights, so it is pretty bright.  It is kind of necessary in non-flourescent lighting as I notice that if I go outside in sunlight I can see a bunch of hairs (stubble) that I didn't know I had.   Anyway, if you want the very best of modern epilators, get this one.  It'll save you tons of money in disposable razors and/or waxing.  It'll pay for itself in just one month.    EDIT: The new Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator  is supposedly more efficient, but it has mixed reviews.  Some say it's wonderful, but others say older models of different brands work better.
like	0	I purchased the Polaroid PoGo today and have done a fair bit of "playing" with this compact little printer over the past couple of hours. In fact, I have already used the first package of 10 sheets of Zink (Zero Ink) paper that come with the printer. So my first recommendation is; if you are planning on buying a PoGo, I highly recommend getting extra paper so you can get through your "testing" phase without having to purchase more paper. However, don't go crazy and buy too much, there are expiration dates on the paper which may affect your picture quality if you take to long to "expose" (print) them.  Connectivity: I have tested the Bluetooth capabilities with my Motorola Q, Laptop Computer (Bluetooth enabled), my desk-top Windows Vista computer (with Radio Shack "Bluespoon" Bluetooth 2.0 adaptor added) and my PictBridge capable Canon Powershot A 640 camera (directly connected to PoGo via USB cable) and the printer worked like a charm in all of the above tests!  Speed of Printing: Print time is about 1 minute per photo. There was no noticeable change in print speed with any of the tests I performed. Using the Bluetooth (wireless) connection or plugging in your USB cable directly from your camera did not seem to make any difference as to how fast the image printed.   Image Quality: Not great...but not the worst I have seen either...The pictures I printed from my camera (via USB connection) looked better than my pictures from my cell phone, but this was likely due to the higher megapixel image created by my camera versus the 1 megapixel image from my cell phone. However, the "white balance" of both my camera and cell phone images were a little "off". The whites were extremely white (almost washed-out) and the dark (shadow areas) were very dark. So if you stay away from printing bright "beach / snow" images or dark "night" photographs you will be OK. Photos with lots of color (flowers, for example) looked pretty good when printed with the PoGo.  Cool things to do: The adhesive on the back of the photo paper is a nice feature of this product. This makes it possible to add pictures to your hand written journals. You can stick them to business card magnets and put photos all over your refrigerator. You can make photo luggage tags, cards and much, much more.   If you don't need the highest quality image, but want to do some fun, creative stuff with photographs I would definitely recommend the PoGo. If you are a photographer hoping that the PoGo would give you a quick "proof" of what your printed images will look like, then this printer is probably not for you, since the image quality is not as good as you could get with some standard ink jet printers.   Have fun...

I was a little worried about what I would encounter, however there worries would soon transition from worried to eased.  The make of this device is very solid and it is a little big for the pocket, but it's manageable. This device would be significantly useful for people on the go as it allows you to bring a large amount of media with you all in a neat little tablet that can handle HD output (Given some videos are going to be laggy, but this is normal for most hand held devices as they do not have the rendering capabilities that of a computer does). However to deal with this, Archos is trying to maintain regular updates. Just recently they released 2 updates for the Archos 5. If you go to the main Archos site, which is at [...] you can look at the updates that have been released for the device. It turns out that with each update they are trying to clean up the HD output given the limitations of the hardware also they are working on another update which is called doughnut, which is version 1.6 android, I believe (which will hopefully include the android market!! :)). This device also has a TON of space.  With all this space it can have other uses as well. I, Personally, have a large collection of books and music, I used this device as a backup of all my files so that in the event that anything happens to my main machine, I will always have the files I prioritized. Another neat little thing that the Archos 5 can do is it can read PDFs and Office Files, which is nice if you ever have to edit your office files on the go.  With the amount of area that is displayed by the screen, it allows for a very nice and ease of reading. At times I can find myself reading a book on it and reading it with ease with the large screen, as well as the capabilities of the software to handle PDFs. One thing to be noted by this is the fact that due to the hardware constraint, it will have to load each page after you read about half of your current page and half of the next page in order to have it load the next page. This is done to save space and maintain its longevity due to its hardware constraints. However, the transitions is very fast, shouldn't be a pain, although a very minor annoyance. One thing I should note is that some people have claimed that some videos are not able to play, although I have yet to encounter this issue.  I feel that I got a huge bargain on this device. Given its updates and overall capabilities as not only an internet tablet but also its media playback along with its touchscreen capabilities (which is acceptable, in practicality -- Make sure that you configure the touchscreen when it seems to not be functioning properly) it almost feels like a steal. To sum up the review I'm going to make a list of pros and cons.  Pros  Large beautiful screen Touch Screen Variety of Media playback capabilities Made with Android OS (very stable) Can be used as a PDF Reader as well as do MORE Has GPS capabilities Lots of applications -- AppsLib (And much more will come when android market is finally released -- although there is a way to get market on it with a little trick-- but it does not include all the times that are in the CURRENT market, its a makeshift to get it to work AND Google applications be installed using this little trick, Google "Android Market on Archos 5 Internet Tablet") Lasts a good amount of time Easy to use  ------------------------  Cons  No android 2.0 (yet..?) Charging is somewhat slow (it will lose charge [when plugged in via DC-IN USB to MiniUSB] when transferring files to it, do it in chunks to deal with this issue, although you'll still lose battery life) Somewhat laggy Video playback (should be remedied somewhat with updates) Locks up sometimes (this was in the past, however with the new update they released I haven't seen it happen..yet?) LONG start up time (use standby)  I hope this review helps you guys decide on buying one :) 
like	0	This 70 pg. book was originally published in 1956 in the journal Psychoanalysis as "Psychoanalytic Observations on Chess and Chess Masters".  As one can derive from this title, the author has attempted to present us with a deeper understanding of certain chess masters using psychoanalysis, and in the process comes up with some interesting but also peculiar (in my opinion, at least) insights. In particular, Fine discusses the following players: Staunton, Anderssen, Morphy, Steinetz, Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Euwe, and Botvinnik.  For someone not familiar with the personalities of these exceptional players, Fine's anecdotal accounts of their personalities and eccentricities is quite facinating.  What kind of made me leary was the general remarks that the author makes in regards to chess and chess players, and how in particular he seems to sexualize the purpose of chess.   For instance, on page 22 he states: "The profuse phallic symbolism of chess provides some fantasy gratification of the homosexual wish, particularly the desire for mutual masterbation.  This is, of course, completely repressed.  Checkmate may be seen as rendering the father impotent, again part of the homosexual complex."  Oh, really?  And here I thoight that chess was a game, to be played for fun and enjoyment, or in some cases competatively.  I can't quite remember ever feeling that it was the expression of a "desire for mutual masterbation"--well, how could I, because I can't, since I'm repressing it.  Well, that's just pure bunk, in my opinion.  Fortunately, this book isn't entirely like this, so it does have its merits, but it clearly isn't must-read chess literature.

This book is not for *everyone* who plays massively multi-player online (MMO) games, but is instead designed specifically for those who are--or are curious about becoming--leaders and officers of guilds, those organized groups that are the lifeblood of MMOs. The book covers a very wide gamut within this topic, but the main take-away is that this book is helpful for ANYONE interested in guild leadership. Those who are wondering what is involved in starting and leading a guild will find a lot of information about how to create a new guild from scratch, while those who are already officers or leaders will find a lot of helpful information for topics like how to deal with churn, personality conflicts, or drama.  The author includes numerous examples--many by way of personal experience--that make it easy for the reader to see how policies or situations may apply in a real in-game situation. Best of all, the author takes great care to ensure that this book is about the role of guild leadership in all MMOs; this is not a book about how to be a guild leader in any one specific game (that is, you won't feel left out that you are a guild leader in a smaller MMO instead of a behemoth like World of Warcraft).  The book is organized in a way that readers can easily go directly to a section and gather practical information, and in that way. Readers should get just as much out of this by picking a specific section to read, as if they sat down and read the book cover to cover.  I see this book as both a cookbook for guild leadership (that is, identifying and finding a particular topic that applies to your situation and looking up solutions), as well as a disaster prevention/management book for how to ensure that your guild runs smoothly.  All in all, this is a highly detailed and unique book that should be very helpful for both current guild leaders and officers, as well as those interested in what is involved in running a guild. If you're feeling generous, consider getting this for your guild leader.

For awhile, you are there - a privileged insider-witness to a marvelous bygone moment in moviemaking history - and it's with a feeling of bittersweet regret that you step from its closing pages back into a realm of noisy 3D sequels and superfluous comic book franchises. Everything you'd want to know and more is delivered in the book, from the reader's coverage producer Marty Jurow was first handed, re: adapting Capote's book for the screen ("In any event this is more of a character sketch than a story. NOT RECOMMENDED") to the guest list for the post-premiere party (including such unlikely elbow-rubbers as Dennis Hopper, Buster Keaton, Charles Laughton, and Jane Mansfield).  A delicious through-line in the book is how close the movie came to not coming out so well as it did, with such jaw-droppers as everyone's resistance to having Henry Mancini write a song for the thing (eventual collaborator Johnny Mercer's original lyric, we learn, one of three eventually presented to Mancini, was called "Blue River").  An intimate exploration of the myriad personalities in conflict and collusion when a casual classic is being created, the book is cannily adept at detailing the logic of the so many minute decisions that lead to what we now accept as inevitable.  Of course Audrey Hepburn played Holly Golightly, you think, until you hear how hard Capote lobbied for Marilyn Monroe.  Wasson is a formidable researcher.  He doesn't so much know where the bodies are buried as he knows where the hearts and minds are hidden.  The book is written like a good novel, taking you inside the consciousness of its characters with an impressive, insight-laden believability ("Fifth Avenue"'s only recent movie-book rival in this regard is Mark Harris' fascinating "Pictures at a Revolution"). And Wasson's notes on how he arrived at, and can justify, his leaps of imagination and empathy are almost as interesting as the text itself.  Of course the book has its thesis and theories as well, positing "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and Hepburn's stylish, fresh, era-defining performance as a watershed moment in cultural history.  If you're a fan of Audrey Hepburn, the book is a must-have, because Wasson's astute take on what she was about, what she was up against, and how she delivered the goods strikes me as definitive.  Her spritely, near-angelic spirit comes alive in the pages of this eminently devour-able book, which is kind of an awesome dividend.

Plugged the thing in and slid in a sleeve of nails and started looking for something to test the nailer. Works awesome although my workbench now has a row of brads in it. I'll give the compressor a workout next weekend when I shingle my folks roof. Looking forward to it already.

I would have given it five stars but the lack of extra's for the price I payed is out there. Where are the deleted scenes that were repeatedly mentioned? If Lucas and Speilberg refuse to do commentary then why aren't there cast commentaries? No outtakes reel! Granted the 2 hour documentary is very nice and I love seeing the trailers its just a set like this should have been loaded. Lets take for example the Back to the Future dvd's, yes there was that whole widescreen issue but the extra's on those dvd's had everything, 2 commentaries for each disk, documentaries, and deleted scenes, plus the price was resonable!  Like I said most of us will be happy with these dvd's for the most part, and for the proper 2:35 widescreen transfers but I felt Lucas could have included a lot more extra's than were included on this set. Marketing I suppose in a few years it will be rereleased again with all new features, but at the moment I think Indiana Jones is almost up there with Star Wars for the record amount of rereleases.

It was not until 1850, when WUTHERING HEIGHTS received a second printing with an introduction by Emily's sister Charlotte, that it attracted a wide readership.  And from that point the reputation of the book has never looked back.  Today it is widely recognized as one of the great novels of English literature.  Even so, WUTHERING HEIGHTS continues to divide readers.  It is not a pretty love story; rather, it is swirling tale of largely unlikeable people caught up in obsessive love that turns to dark madness.  It is cruel, violent, dark and brooding, and many people find it extremely unpleasant.  And yet--it possesses a grandeur of language and design, a sense of tremendous pity and great loss that sets it apart from virtually every other novel written.  The novel is told in the form of an extended flashback.  After a visit to his strange landlord, a newcomer to the area desires to know the history of the family--which he receives from Nelly Deans, a servant who introduces us to the Earnshaw family who once resided in the house known as Wuthering Heights.  It was once a cheerful place, but Old Earnshaw adopted a "Gipsy" child who he named Heathcliff.  And Catherine, daughter of the house, found in him the perfect companion: wild, rude, and as proud and cruel as she.  But although Catherine loves him, even recognizes him as her soulmate, she cannot lower herself to marry so far below her social station.  She instead marries another, and in so doing sets in motion an obsession that will destroy them all.  WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a bit difficult to "get into;" the opening chapters are so dark in their portrait of the end result of this obsessive love that they are somewhat off-putting.  But they feed into the flow of the work in a remarkable way, setting the stage for one of the most remarkable structures in all of literature, a story that circles upon itself in a series of repetitions as it plays out across two generations.  Catherine and Heathcliff are equally remarkable, both vicious and cruel, and yet never able to shed their impossible love no matter how brutally one may wound the other.  As the novel coils further into alcoholism, seduction, and one of the most elaborately imagined plans of revenge it gathers into a ghostly tone: Heathcliff, driven to madness by a woman who is not there but who seems reflected in every part of his world--dragging her corpse from the grave, hearing her calling to him from the moors, escalating his brutality not for the sake of brutality but so that her memory will never fade, so that she may never leave his mind until death itself.  Yes, this is madness, insanity, and there is no peace this side of the grave or even beyond.  It is a stunning novel, frightening, inexorable, unsettling, filled with unbridled passion that makes one cringe.  Even if you do not like it, you should read it at least once--and those who do like it will return to it again and again.  GFT, Amazon Reviewer
like	0	the ipod touch 3rd generation is definitely the best multi-functional music player in the market. I got the first gen. 16GB ipod touch when it first came out 2 years ago but I ran out of space but I decided to skip the 2nd gen. because ipods are expensive so I got the 32GB 3rd gen. when it came out. But if you already have the 2nd gen. ipod touch you should save yourself the money and wait for the 4th. when hopefully a camera and a built-in mic would be standard features because this is not such a major update besides a faster processor, new stock headphones, and lower prices.  However, this ONLY applies to the 32GB and 64GB versions as others have noted. The 3rd gen. 8GB version is exactly the same as the 2nd gen. except it is repackaged so even with the reduced price, the 8GB is an inferior deal.  The first thing I noticed was how much the price of the ipod touch has dropped since its debut. The 16GB was $399 when it first came out and now this 32GB is only $299 ($279 on amazon). This does makes sense because that is how the market works but this is a very good deal.  Obviously $300 is not money to be thrown around, but the ipod touch is well-rounded and offers many features other than just being a decent music player. I personally could not tell any difference in sound quality from my 1st gen. and my 3rd gen. touch, which is a major disappointment because the basic function of an ipod is a music player and improvements are always welcome if not necessary.   The 3rd gen. offers really shoddy and quiet internal speakers, which is better than nothing on the 1st gen. and the stock Apple headphones are just terrible.  Note that the 32GB and 64GB versions come with headphones that have a built-in mic and music player controls, but they are basically the same. So you should factor in the cost of buying new headphones.   Some respectable brands for headphones or earbuds are Klipsch, Shure and Bose. I personally use Bose overear headphones because the noise that they block off really makes a difference on the crowded subway. While looking for headphones keep in mind that like all things out there, price and quality (and warrenties) have a direct correlation. But really, the ipod touch sound quality is not bad at all as much as I bash it.  What makes me give 5 stars to this 3rd gen. ipod touch is the fact that its overall package is unmatched in the market today, even with the new Zune HD (the Zune has a much inferior internet browser and limited apps). I am not going to make a comparison between them because both music players attract different audiences, where ipod touch users prefer the apps and the interface while zune users find the Zune Marketplace to be much better than itunes (Marketplace prices for music are cheaper and are a better value especially for heavy downloaders). But for the casual music listener, both are the very similar in form, function, and price.  The 3rd gen. ipod touch has a terrific internet browser that is superior to the Blackberry, but its limitations are that it requires a wifi connection and it does not support adobe flash. I use it to jot down notes quickly, to view my documents on my subway to study, check my mail, look up something quickly on the internet, and obviously to listen to music. There is a plethora of apps that can be downloaded and many are free and quite useful like AIM and SportsTap, and Remote. Apple advertises the ipod touch for the games that it can play and you will not be disappointed if you want to play something on the go.  Th 3.5 inch screen is crisp and watching videos is a pleasure. And the ipod touch does look great with clean lines but if you don't want to get the backplate scratched, you must by a case. The screen itself on the other hand is very scratch-resistant.   I highly recommend the new 3rd generation ipod touch for those who are looking for something in this price range and want a balanced music player that can also play vidoes, surf the web, and play quick  games. In a way, people are also paying for the Apple brand, which is not a bad thing considering you can bring your ipod to the apple store to get it fixed, you can purchase many different accessories, and you can have special compatibility features with other apple products such as with macbooks if you already own one or your school/business uses them.

Overall this is a great device to go along with your LG tv.  One point of note, if you have this, you do not need the wireless dongle that is sold separately for the tv.  All the same features are in this device, ie. Netflix,Pandora,Vudu,etc.. the only draw back without using the dongle is you have to have this turned on and the sound will need to come from it rather than the tv.  Not really a big deal as you would probably want it on anyway if streaming a movie or music.  It will also turn on and off automatically with the tv, as well as turning the tv on when it is turned on.  Great thinking on LG's part.  Make sure you update the firmware as the menus are very slow without it.  Actually come to think of it, that was automatic after finding the network.  LG did a great job combining all these features into a tiny package.  I'm an Audiophile and never thought I would accept the sound quality of such a device, but come to find out I do!  All of my other equipment is high end, and I can honestly say for the price/features this device has, it delivers.  Build quality is ok for what it is.  I would have liked it to have a little more heft and a powered subwoofer rather than passive, but again given what it can do it's a nice piece of equipment.  If you are looking for a nice compact solution with decent sound for a living room I would go for it.

My friend insisted for two years that I should read "Twilight", but I kept thinking, "Teen vampire romance?  Not my kind of book."  Finally, this 29-year-old mother of three was on a flight by myself with some time to read, so I bought "Twilight".  I absolutely DEVOURED it--I read one book a day until I had finished the entire saga in four days. Luckily, "Breaking Dawn" had just been released, so I didn't have to wait.  The "Twilight" books are my absolute FAVORITE guilty pleasure--I love the fluff, the cheesy dialogue, the LOVE--all of it.  For me, "New Moon" really needed to redeem all that was wrong with the "Twilight" movie.  After watching "Twilight" last year, I was SO disappointed.  Catherine Hardwicke had just taken our beloved series and turned it into a made-for-TV movie.  I laughed at all of the wrong places.  How Bella and Edward fell in love was completely rushed.  I could go on.  Melissa Rosenberg butchered the book and everything that made me obsessed with it.  Sure, "Twilight" was fun to watch because it was "Twilight", but the portrayal was so, so, so wrong on so many levels.  My favorite book had been reduced to lines like "spider monkey."  WELL, "NEW MOON" JUST MADE UP FOR EVERY CATHERINE-HARDWICKE WRONG!  FANS OF THE BOOK WILL ADORE THIS MOVIE.  Edward actually smiles!  The acting was SO much better, the visuals were stunning, and the dialogue was much, much improved over "Twilight".  I honestly didn't want it to end.  It stayed so true to the book we all love, and the little additions were perfect.  I really felt like I was watching Bella on screen--Kristen Stewart was spot on.  Every expression, every sad word was perfect.  AND THEY SAID, "I LOVE YOU," something that was blaringly absent in "Twilight".  Chris Weitz has made a stunning, gorgeous film that lovers of the book will adore!  **I secretly wish he could remake "Twilight".  This is what "Twilight" should have been!**  This closet Twilighter was pleased beyond belief.  It seems like most of the critics' negative reviews have problems with the plot, the story, etc.  Well, if you like the book and, therefore, like the plot and the story, you will love the film because Chris Weitz is true to the book beyond what I could have imagined or hoped for.  This movie felt like it was made for the fans, so I can understand that if you're not a fan of the series how it may feel like a laboured effort to watch "New Moon".  But if you love Bella and Edward **and even Jacob--Taylor Lautner was FANTASTIC in this!**, you will leave wanting more!  Chris Weitz for "Breaking Dawn"!
like	0	There are two things I take very seriously in this life:  one is books, the other is coffee (not surprisingly, the often go together).  While the bulk of my reviews are children's books, I felt it necessary to go against type and review this coffee grinder. Most coffee experts as well as everyday, casual drinkers agree that the best tasting coffee is brewed with freshly ground beans.  Once beans are ground, they begin to oxidize, much like an opened bottle of wine.  Old preground coffee has a tendency to taste bitter, and with the proliferation of inexpensive grinders, more and more people are buying whole bean coffee to grind right before they brew. Of course, finding the RIGHT grinder for the price is the tough part.  Grinders exist in every form and size and expense bracket.  Quite a lot of round, domed grinders I've used have unsharpened blades on a mount that is too high to really grind beans fine enough for specialty coffee like espresso or Turkish.  The Krups has a few advantages over other grinders, namely these:   ** The blades are sharp and mounted low in the housing.  Maybe other manufactures are saving a few pennies by putting flat tongues of metal in their grinders, but they don't have the edge to pulverize beans like the Krups can.  ** The machine has a higher RPM than other machines.  This makes it easier to reduce grind times and with additional speed, can reduce whole beans to powder in less than a minute (I've had a Black n' Decker that couldn't grind beans for Turkish coffee if you held the button for half an hour). ** the housing is oval and the lid is flat.  I'm not an engineer or physicist, but I think the flat lid and oval shape allow the beans to fall back towards the blades for further grinding (again, my Black n' Decker allowed the beans to spin around the lid in a whirlpool pattern that was pretty to look at, but pointless for actually reducing the grounds to the small particles I wanted). **  it has a large capacity.  Do you like strong coffee??  Use more grounds, then!!  The box says that you can grind up to 20 cups of java at a time.  I don't know about the sorts of demitasses they must be using to gauge the volume of a &quot;cup&quot;, but I do know that this machine can grind up enough beans for a number of very stiff MUGS of coffee. In the disadvantages column, the only one I could site is that the housing cup is slanted down, I'm assuming for decorative purposes.  Hence, I'm forever spilling beans out of the lower side.  My new secret is to measure the beans out in the LID, first, then turn the whole thing upside down and put the housing into the lid.  Since I only use it to grind coffee (and while I drink my fair share, I don't have the thing running nonstop day and night), I can't speak with any aplomb about how sturdy a machine is or how long it lasts.  I once dropped one after a year and broke it, but it seemed nowhere near quitting, so I can't vouch for how long it would work under normal, non-butterfingered conditions.  My assumption is that anything with such a high RPM rate isn't intended to be kept running for long periods of time-- creates too much heat and friction-- so if you plan to grind coffee night and day, it's probably best that you spend the money on a professional model intended for cafes. All in all, a fine piece of workmanship and definitely worth the extra few dollars over many of the other, cheaper, more poorly-designed grinders on the market today.

I was waiting for some sense of action or suspense in the movie and this did not happen once. This was the first movie that I almost fell asleep watching. I was ready for it to finish.

If you liked &quot;Signs&quot; or any of the book to movie adaptations of Bronte, I recommend this movie.

like	0	 In college I went through a phase where I read all the Sherlock Holmes stories. Once I got started reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, I didn't want to stop. It was sad when I read the last story.   Now years later it was fun to read them again. I enjoy the Sherlock Holmes short stories more than one of the novels. For me one of the most enjoyable parts of a Sherlock Holmes story is reading about what happened, and then reading how Sherlock Holmes solved the problem. A collection of short stories provides this experience many times.   This collection has many classics. It has the famous line "It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." (The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet.)   It is also interesting to see what life was like in England 100 years ago. They had the underground, but use carriages, there was lots of travel by train, and life in general was a bit rougher than today.   If you haven't read any Sherlock Holmes stories, this is a good place to start.

Pushing comedy boundaries again in their second season, Tim and Eric are even more disturbing this time around and even more creative in their second season.  If you enjoyed (or hated) Season 1 this one probably won't sway your opinion either way. Besides the amazing duo of T&E you get great guest stars such as Raine Wilson, Patton Oswalt, and the incomparable John C. Reilly. (as Dr. Steven Brule)  This, like T&E's previous show Tom Goes to the Mayor is guilty of polarizing comedy fans on the Adult Swim network block. It's perhaps too adult for some and is maybe too silly for others. It's a great watch if you enjoy absurd and unsettling humor, though.

Imagine a cold piece of butter slowly melting in a frying pan, setting the scene for the cooking to come, and you  can see the way Roy's prose works. Words that are hot and brooding reel you  into an intricate web of family politics and social mores, evoking a  feeling similar to a written stream of consciencness.  	Roy writes in  layers, except that the layers are both added and taken off; I was reminded  of my childhood when I would eat wafer chocolates from the bottom and the  top, leaving the middle until last, because that was the best part. Roy  kindly dispells the, often torturous, anxiety of what happens in the end  early on in the book. The reader is told what happened before it happened,  what happened after it happened, and saves what happened for last. A format  that seemingly would put off a reader becomes its most appreciated quality.  	This book is for everyone; murder mystery, love story, epic saga all in  one. Even if you're not the romantic type, the social scrutiny of Indian  customs provides for interesting reading. However, if you're interested in  brain candy, forget it. There is too much to absorb. Emotion and intellect  are needed in order to understand the emotion and intellect that are  related. You could take in only what is superficially presented, as the  plot alone is worthwhile, but you would be missing so much. 	Rahel, a  dizygotic twin returns to the place of her childhood and subesequently a  place of unhappiness to see her brother, the other twin, after more than  twenty years of separation. Esta, the brother, has stopped talking, and  Rahel has stopped feeling. Their reunion allows for the remembrance and  grieving of their disasterous youths. They recall small things, seemingly  unimportant, yet vital to the reconstruction of their sense of inner peace.   	They are the same age as their mother when she died, thirty-one.  Their house is run down and the only relatives left from the monster in  their pasts are, in essence, only waiting to die. Entering their minds  through an omniscient voice, we are transported back and forth in time,  remembering small things, painting a big picture. We remember a cousin's  accidental death, and the death of another who served as a scapegoat. We  remember how fate can make the strangest families. We also remember Rahel  and Esta, and how they "broke the love laws. That lay down who should be  loved. And how. And how much." 	While the novel serves to shock the  reader from time to time, the pace is slow. Roy's style would be described  as somewhat verbose for the impatient, yet serves to parallel the way we  deal with emotions, hurt, and love in life.  Creating a paradox however,  this reader went back to re-absorb certain elements of beauty or truth, due  to a lack of time created by an impatience to find out what happens next. 	 Although usually overly critical of fiction, I would recommend this book  for anyone who likes to read intelligent literature. It gives the reader a  chance to realize how profound those small things really are.

For those who do not know what media bias really is, do read this book...  I got an early copy of this book somehow, and I finished it in 2 days (which is NOT normal for me...)
like	0	There are some things to consider before buying this particular card or any other 32gb SDHC card on the market:    1. This is NOT an ideal card for a digital SLR like a D80, D90, Rebel XT, etc... That is because it is a class 4 device. The class of a SDHC cards has to do with how fast they read and write files, not how much storage they have. For a digital SLR, you should purchase a class 6 SDHC card most of the time. Class 6 cards will allow you to take 'bursts' of photos and not be limited by the card's capacity to write them. Also class 4 cards are slower reading data, meaning they will take longer to upload files to your computer. Upload speed is convenient, especially when loading large batches of files.    2. This card has far more storage than most people will need for their digital camera. Unless you like to keep all your photos on a SDHC card and never move them to your computer, or are a high volume photographer, there is very little need for more than about 8gb of storage space for most caeras. The possible exception to this is if you have a professional SLR that shoots files in the 16-20mb range--but if you do, you'll likely want a class 6 card anyway. If all you intend to use this card for is a digital camera, save yourself a lot of money and buy a PNY 8GB SDHC Card . If you're worried about running out of space on a vacation, buy a few of them. Otherwise you run the risk of having 'all your eggs in one basket.' If one card fails, you lose all your pictures instead of only a portion of them.   This card is fantastic for use in a video camcorder capable of writing to an SDHC card. (Check with the manual first to insure that a class 4 card will be fast enough first). It is also perfect as extra storage for an ultra portable computer or net book like the Asus EEE pc. Another great application would be as added storage to a personal media player or MP3 player equipped with a SDHC slot such as the Cowon D2 .   There are other good 32gb SDHC cards on the market, some at cheaper price points than the Kingston card. IMHO, brand matters very little with something like a SDHC card, since they all are made pretty much the same way. None of the brands currently offering them (Transcend, PNY, Kingston) have high fail rates with their other products, so I believe they are all pretty similar. What you decide to buy will depend on whether you trust a particular brand, or who has the lowest price. All of them will work equally well.
like	0	 M.A.S. Abdel Haleem's English translation of the Qur'an is the best that I have seen. Some of the other English translations available, use awkward forms and archaic words that are difficult and tedious for the modern reader. But Haleem's translation is easy to read, yet scholarly. His footnotes, chapter intro's, and the historical background preface, is highly informative to the western reader; who may not be familiar with the history of Islam.  My problem is not with the translation, it is with the book itself. For a supposedly holy book, the Qur'an is rife with errors. Take for example Chapter 20 (Ta Ha), where Pharaoh supposedly tells his magicians that for their betrayal to Moses, they'll be crucified. The Exodus took place around the 14th century B.C. however, crucifixion was not invented until the 6th century B.C. by the Persians. In chapter 58 (The Dispute) Allah permits lying, but he damns those who "knowingly" lie. Does that make any sense? The Quran also permits hitting women ch 4:34, lying (because Allah is a liar ch 3:54), Jihad (holy war against non-Muslims ch 3:168-175), and in no uncertain terms damns those who believe that Jesus is God (Christians) ch 4:170-173. The Qur'an is also very anti-Semitic.   The Qur'an does not even compare to the Bible in: reliability, historicity, complexity, beauty, or applicability. No, the Qur'an seems like a jumbled collection of chapters that are highly repetitive and lack any real sense of order or flow. The Allah of the Qur'an takes delight in damning the non-believers, and repeatedly states that those who "ascribe partners with God" (Christians and the Trinity for example), will be damned.  Don't believe me? I took notes throughout the entire book, noting the errors, contradictions, and hateful theology that are found in the Qur'an. I challenge others to do the same.  So people need to read the Qur'an before thinking that Islam and Christianity are compatible, because clearly they are not! The Jesus of the Qur'an is a prophet; the Jesus of the Bible is God, big difference people!! And it doesn't stop there! Haleem's translation is good, but the book that he translated is not!!!

I didn't have a way to play it then, but I do now, so even if this review isn't terribly timely, I hope you'll find it helpful.  The game takes place in the world of Albion, a beautiful, lovely world somewhere between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. In that it quickly differentiates itself from most fantasy worlds.  You play the Hero. You don't get a name, but you can get titles (like Lionheart, Executioner or the NAMBLA-friendly, Chicken Chaser). You can be male or female, good or evil. You can marry the opposite sex or the same sex. You can customize your looks with new hair styles, tattoos, facial hair and hair dye. You get all sorts of different clothes to pick from, and get scars when you die. You also age.  In addition, you get a whole slew of skills. You can learn how to chop wood, for example. If that's not exciting enough, you can also tend bar! Blacksmithing, bounty hunting and a couple other jobs round things out.  If jobs aren't your thing, you can go on a whole series of quests, though not very many. During these quests, you can earn gold which you can use to buy all the usual stuff, plus real estate. Yes, if you want you can become the next Donald Trump! One of my friends has done this and basically owns every bit of property that can be owned.  This is an action RPG, which is different from regular RPGs in that you don't select options from a menu screen. No, instead you bash, smash and crush your enemies by repeated button-mashing. Think of the Zelda games. You have both melee weapons and ranged weapons as well as a series of spells, some of which can be lots of fun!  Along the way, you have a dog acting as your faithful companion. Allegedly he helps in fights, but not so you'd notice. What he mostly does is sniff out treasure, and that's a damn nice thing, given how well-hidden some of the treasure chests are.  Graphics wise, this is one of the most beautiful games on any system. Everything looks gorgeous, even the darker and more unpleasant spots.  If it seems like I'm focusing overly much on the non-story aspects of the game, it's cause the story, well, kind of falls short. It's the usual "fight against someone who killed your sister" kind of plot. Nothing memorable. It's also rather brief. There's nothing wrong with it, per se, but it's not very original.  Still, the joy is in the journey, and this is one of the best games of its kind out there. Highly recommended!

And I'm not 12 years old, mind you, and neither are many of the other people who found &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; likable -- many adults like Hanson, too. I  don't care how many CDs you have, and I don't care about your life story,  either. You've got to relize something about Hanson and &quot;Middle of  Nowhere&quot;. This was written/co-written and co-produced by the band  Hanson themselves, when Ike was 16, Tay was 14, and when Zac was 11. You  have got to be crazy not to think that these boys (yes, they are boys) are  talented. You have to admit it, even if you don't like their music. What's  more, they play their own instruments. Why don't you go bother BSB or *N  SYNC or something because, unlike the hard working Hanson bros., they don't  write their music, they don't write their lyrics, they don't play  instruments for their music, and their music isn't good anyway. But take  &quot;M.O.N.&quot;:  It's not my favorite, but I really like it a lot. The  songs were written from the band's personal expriences (&quot;With You In  Your Dreams&quot; and &quot;MMMBop&quot;- you just have to listen to the  words) and what teens really feel and think (&quot;Weird&quot;,  &quot;Thinking of You&quot;, ect., ect.). All *N SYNC ever sings about is  breaking up with some girl, still loving that girl, and wanting her back.  One theme. On one of Hanson's very mature songs, &quot;Weird&quot; (which  happens to be my favorite Hanson song), they sing about feeling left out  and wishing someone was there who understood them. I don't care how old you  are, everyone has felt that why or will feel that way or do feel that way.  &quot;Thinking of You&quot; is about a boy with a crush on some girl, but  can't be with her (I guess because he can't tell her how he feels about  her). Everyone feels like that. &quot;With You In Your Dreams&quot; was  written by Hanson alone for their dieing grandmother. I don't care what you  say, these boys DO have talent, even if you think this CD is bad or  good! My favorits: &quot;Weird&quot; (my most fave), &quot;MMMBop&quot;,  &quot;Madeline&quot;, &quot;Yearbook&quot;, and &quot;Look  at You,  Baby&quot;. I really don't like &quot;Thinking of You&quot; and  &quot;Lucy&quot;, but they're okay. The rest of the songs are really  good, too. They don't really sound like the Jackson 5, but some of  Hanson's songs have a 60's and 70's sound to them. Also, &quot;Weird&quot;,  &quot;Yearbook&quot;, &quot;I Will Come To You&quot;, and &quot;With You In  Your Dreams&quot; are very mature and are NOT (I repeat; NOT)  &quot;teeny-bopper&quot;!

And it goes on...all at same time, iPhone cannot do more than one at a time, we get millions of free software, games, themes etc., unlike Apple App store, no need to pay more and more. Best feature, no MP3 conversion required, if you have lot of MP3 files on hard disk just drag and drop in few seconds, we can play, phone comes with 8GB of SD Card, can upgrade to 16 GB, that's more than enough, I had used the N95 earlier which costs double this price, this is not a NSeries phone from nokia, but it had all the features + touch screen of N series phone at half the price.  If you like Garmin for GPS, Garmin GPS software available for this phone and installing that will make it the best GPS (it comes with Nokia's map software too) and no data plan or internet required for GPS as maps are copied to memory. It comes with lot of add on and Its not too big like iPhone and not too small, exactly made for using with single hand and I had replaced the blackberry phone used for Office with this and configured my Office outlook exchange server along with Gmail, hotmail and yahoo, how cool is that.  It handles website just as a PC and there is no difference with any websites, I can login to bank accounts and do anything like PC, it has stereo speakers but the Nokia Headsets are far Superior in sound quality and build and it comes with built in Mic and buttons for music track change so we can play music and attend calls without touching phone.  And FM is there to use while driving and at the Gym, Google has lot of software available for this phone like latitude, docs etc. If you want free chat software Fring (www.fring.com) is available for free, it connects yahoo, hotmail, AOL, Gtalk and Skype users all in one place and we can even make voice calls to online users. It has the great sync software that syncs all your photos, videos, contacts, notes etc between phone and PC using Bluetooth, just switch on the PC and it does the sync automatically. We can import and export all contacts from outlook, Lotus notes etc.  And there is software to use the screen as a touch screen mouse for the PC like a wireless Bluetooth mouse and that's free too.  For brand conscious users like me, I want to buy a phone from a telecom company like Nokia than a computer (apple) or TV (Samsung) company, who were just trying phones as one of their business.  iPhone doesn't have many of these features and only selling because of marketing, if nokia did their part, this should beat any phone for sure, I don't want to lock with AT&T for lifetime with iPhone and pay $ monthly and pay for any applications and did I say its unlocked? What else you can expect from a phone?

He also has gotten bad diaper rashes from other 'sposie brands, but the Seventh Generation are as kind to his skin as his cloth dipes!  As he's gotten older, wet diapers bother him more, so I'm ordering some Seventh Generations to put on him for nighttime so that I can hopefully start getting more uninterrupted sleep (please, please, God, let this work).  They're definitely absorbent enough to last all night, even on the nights that he spends nursing every two hours.  They're also nice and trim - he's a slender guy, and it's  nice that we can find a good fit that isn't too bulky!  Do I wish they were as cheap as generic disposables?  Absolutely!  But, not to put too fine a point on it, I feel my suspicions about the safety of the products used to make those have been confirmed.  It never fails that after we use them, if we have to borrow a dipe at a playdate or similar situation, my son has a red, sunburn-like rash all over his bottom, which goes away with a little bit of salve and a switch back to Seventh Generations or cloth.  From now until potty training, I'm staying stocked up on the Seventh Generations.

Showing a very good range, Lambert hits both the rockers and ballads with a nice balance of hubris and control.  The first three cuts hit hard, with up tempo beats and a surprisingly plaintive vocal on "Whattaya Want From Me" gives the listener a good indication of what Lambert can do. "Strut" then takes things into more stylized mode and Lambert shows a bit of the over the top quality so necessary to pull off this style of song. Throughout the CD he surprises with a variety of styles and contributors like Rivers Cuomo and Pink keep things interesting. He still needs to find his own true voice, many things owe a bit too much to those who came before, ("Soaked" definitely seems to channel Mercury a bit too closely and a few others smack of pastiche rather than homage.) but overall this is an impressive debut.

The knife is extremely sharp and because the key is pretty thin it can rotate easily in your fingers. It's not incredibly easy to close around a key ring with one hand, and does with a bit of a snap, so you need to make sure your fingers are well out of the way when you do.  The Phillips screwdriver on the end of one of the tines is helpful for things like tightening eyeglasses, but it is slightly offset from the opposing blade and I've nicked or jabbed myself with it more than once while it's in my pocket.  You're supposed to lock it at either 90 or 180 degrees when using it, but when you close it from 90 the keyring end easily grabs at your fingers.  This isn't a product for kids, and only should be used with extreme care.

Season 5 really caught my attention last year, I have to admit I never cared for this show when these characters were in high school, the storylines were over-the-top but now I enjoy the maturity. I have recently gone back and watched the previous seasons and I still don't care for all the hoopla - Season 6 is just brilliant so start here and work your way back. Sophia Bush's character Brooke Davis really got to shine this season, she took in Sam, a wise beyond her years teenage girl - fell in love with Peyton's ex Julian and made amends with her emotionally distant mother. The season finale seemed like a series finale but I heard the show will back next season. This prime time soap is a guilty pleasure and I am proud of it!

I also firmly believe that having more children than you can take care of/support is a sin as well. When looking at the various types of birth control there are some that prevent fertilization and others that prevent implantation of the fertilized egg in the womb. The majority of pills do the later. Birth control using methods that prevent the embryo from living further breaks the commandment of "Thou shalt not kill" and constitutes a sin. I would love to hear what others think about these statements.

My sister just started high school, she's 15 and she lent New Moon and the first book, Twilight to me.  Despite our age gap (I'm sixteen years older) I found them a very engaging and entertaining read.  I'm glad to share these with her and I'd suggest them to anyone who is staring at a younger, somewhat mysterious female relative wondering what to buy them for Christmas.  The pacing is good.  The book is a quick, satisfying read.  My feeling is that the author works through scenes rather than writing in a linear fashion- and the scenes are fairly cinematic in their structure which I personally like.  She gets to the point in her stories and fits a lot of action and significant detail in without overwhelming you with a density of vision.    If you're concerned about the content, as in "Is this appropriate to give my neice/cousin's kid etc" you can be assured that the romantic tension captured here is through restraint rather than exploration.  Not too surprizingly this is highly seductive.  Several reviews seem disappointed by the character's actions and have given fewer stars.  However, I'd like to say that this book is clearly part of a larger work and we're seeing Bella at a certain point in her personal growth.  It is not a conclusion novel so it doesn't feel like one.  She acts like, well, a confused person in love.  I think the depiction is honest and it is a good thing when a character can annoy or drive you crazy: it means you're engaged and the author has done their job well.  I'll be honest- I wasn't expecting to be drawn in, now I'm a bit annoyed I have to wait until next fall.    New Moon is the sequel to Twilight, so I'm covering both in my review.  I think it could stand alone but I'd stronly recommend reading Twilight first as it really gives the foundations and 'rules' of Bella's world.

First the good sides:  This thing is very fast, opening and closing applications is quick, the screen is incredibly responsive, there is no lag while typing, and the built in Safari browser does a great job of quickly loading even graphic intense pages.  The not so good sides:  As has been thoroughly pointed out, there is not presently much in the way of multitasking within the iPhone OS, but with most expectations pointing towards a summer release of OS 4.0 this might be remedied by mid summer, and almost certainly by a generation 2 release.  That said, it should be kept in mind that on such a little screen being able to view multiple applications at once will likely never be something you'll use, and the speed by which you can open and close applications makes this less a headache than you might think.  It isn't as fast as moving between open apps, but it isn't a deal breaker by any means.  The lack of a camera in this generation is a little surprising, while I've purchased my iPad already, I honestly believe that with the number of competitors expected over the course of 2010 we're probably going to see a generation 2 by Christmas with a camera.  It's still an amazing device, but the ability to video chat with it would definitely put it over the top, that's a feature worth waiting for.  The lack of Flash support isn't as irritating as I expected it to be, but still something to consider.  Many major sites have evolved to html5, or are in the process of doing so.  This allows for full viewing by the Safari browser, and where it exists, it works great.  The remaining sites still using Flash show up with annoying little boxes looking for a plugin that is likely never going to exist.  If you spend a lot of time on flash heavy sites it really probably is worth considering holding out to see how the Slate/Android Tablets look in a few months, but if you're mostly just e-mailing and checking facebook (no Farmville) the lack of Flash support probably won't bother you too much.  As a laptop replacement:  The inclusion of the iWorks utilities gives this device a little bit of a laptop personality.  Don't let that persuade you into believing that you don't need a computer though.  You might be able to get away with ditching a laptop if all you really do is e-mail or very light word processing, but if you do anything more than that you'll like the freedom and ease a full computer offers for more complex tasks.  That said, this device is a tremendous leap towards a future tablet style device that may very well be a replacement for your computer, but for now it is more of a casual use device than something you can really expect to do substantial work with.  I have put together a presentation in keynote, which was easy enough to do, but pages isn't as intuitive as I'd have liked, and taking lengthy notes or writing long letters/e-mails/reports will probably make it worth considering buying either the keyboard dock or the wireless bluetooth keyboard.  Battery life seems to live up to the claims, I managed to get about 7 hours before getting the 20% remaining battery life indication, which puts it about right for 10 hours or so of total use.  One very important thing to realize about charging the device is that presently (at launch) there is some issues with charging via USB from many computers.  The iPad is different than other iPod products, it requires a bit more power to charge up, and unfortunately most USB ports aren't set up to support that higher power draw.  This is something that may be fixed in a firmware update to allow for a slower charge, or it may simply be that you'll need to either rely on a new Mac (seems like they can handle the power issue) or rely on the wall charger.  Just don't be surprised if you plug it into your computer and it doesn't show that it is charging.  All in all, the iPad is an impressive device that might make for a reasonable replacement of a netbook for casual users.  For people who need something to really do a lot of work on, you may find that for the price that a netbook or laptop still offers the better value for your needs.  Future generations of this device will probably transition into fitting that market better than this first generation.  However, if you're an avid reader, casual gamer, music fan, who doesn't do much more on the web than check a few sites, and e-mail.  This thing is definitely worth considering!  If you're on the fence, nothing about this product is so incredible as to justify running out and buying one right now, but it is worthy of your consideration if you're thinking you might like a tablet style device.  I definitely would encourage you to go play with one at best buy or an apple store to get a feel for it.  With a number of competitors due out over the next few months we're likely to see some price movement, or a second generation release, so it may be worth it to wait it out a little while.  One final note, the screen is absolutely gorgeous while it is turned on.  It is crisp, bright, and very easy to see from any angle.  But when you turn it off, every finger print and swipe is suddenly very visible (while it is on the light is bright enough you don't see them fingerprints).  If you are a neat freak, or just hate finger prints on your devices you'll have to invest in some microfiber cloths or get used to using your shirt sleeve!  In conclusion, it's a lot of fun, and I'm not the least bit sorry to have bought one.  It does many things, and over the next months will do many more.  If you think you want one, go play with one, and if you don't want to wait for a next generation this one is definitely awesome.  If you have specific needs that aren't really addressed in this generation or by apple, don't let the hype or peer pressure bully you into this one, there are a number of devices coming with great potential, one of those might be a better fit.

Battery life probably about 4 hours talk time, but too soon for me to be sure. Menu easy to use and can download manual from manufacturer's site. Transfer of media to PC and download very user friendly. Lots of features, though T-Mobile does not support some of them (make sure you check with your provider). The bad so far: not much memory, so you will need a memory card if planning to use the media features, whether video, music, or other. I haven't tested the quality of video and camera. Music speaker is great, considering it is only a phone. Summary: if you are looking for data/office/messaging primarily and the phone is your primary access to the web/e-mail, then this is not the best choice. This phone is a great option for those like me who are wanting an actual real phone with media (i.e. songs, radio, camera, video),internet and e-mail access, don't do tremendous amount of messaging, and everything else is a bonus. It also has a great task/organizer that is very easy to use. By the way, T-mobile has a very nice feature (web2go), which is a limited internet access, also for those who do not use the phone as a primary internet venue but want some internet capability. It is not available with most phones, where you have to buy the whole package (internet and messaging), but it is available with this phone, which makes it very affordable as you do not have to purchase the whole data package in addition to the phone. Also, the phone is just cool. Love when it lits up and the flip design is so much more convenient to hold than the sliders or data phones. Haven't used the radio yet. Hope this helps.

I can now do the whole 30 minute level 1 work out. Next week I am going to be adding level 2. In only 2 1/2 weeks I have lost 14 inches and 12 lbs. Now I still have 80 to go, but it is a good start. Bob does the level 1, and he keeps me motivated thru the whole work out. Right when I think I am about to die, he starts counting down, and tells me I can do it, and I believe him. Rather than sitting on my couch hoping the Biggest Loser comes and casts me, I decided that the more logical option would be to bring the biggest loser trainers to me. I would recommend this to everyone, from those who only have 10 lbs to lose to people like me who have 50+.

Ellis formally introduced his REBT therapeutic model in 1955, but at the time, few knew and fewer cared. However, this book would change that forever. No longer would we have to settle for self-help pablum like "The Power of Positive Thinking", because now we had a piercing book for the masses that explained both clearly and thoroughly three things that no popular work had ever told us before. First, we don't just "get" upset, we "do" upset. Or, in other words, we make ourselves emotionally disturbed. Second, the authors plainly explain how we make ourselves upset. We create our own emotional disturbances mainly through our irrational (aka, unhealthy, self-defeating) thinking. And third, Ellis and Harper give us many effective techniques to combat these thinking patterns. The techniques suggested are divided into cognitive, emotive and behavioral categories, although in fact there is significant overlap for the simple reason, as the authors point out, that we don't just think or feel or behave in a vacuum. Rather, we are thinking/feeling/behaving beings, and this interplay, luckily enough, offers us many ways to a "profound philosophic change" in our outlook, which is the goal of this work. Easily, the most influential self-help book ever written and rightfully so!

It is made from suet, flour, sugar, currants and raisins, and is usually served with treacle.  The Heinz canned version is a very different animal, a member of the sponge pudding race, containing no suet.  It is nice enough, and is especially good with English-style custard.  It is tasty, filling and easy to prepare, and its name makes it great fun.  But if you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin stories and want to eat like them, be warned that this is not the real thing.  The genuine Spotted Dick (or Dog), described in O'Brian's books, is the glorious suet pudding of my youth. [PeterReeve]

The first couple of pages grabbed me--there was no reading half the book before I decided I liked it.  Pickard writes in an easy style about people and life in Kansas, but it could be any rural/ranching setting.  The characters were described so perfectly that I felt like I grew up with them.  This is a murder mystery, but it's definitely not your typical who-done-it.  The plot unfolds gently--no harsh, sharp twists and turns.  It's also a love story and a story of a close-knit family.  It has everything but nothing is contrived; it's all very natural and believable.  I think the best way to describe the book is that it's a gentle, easy story about some ungentle events. I can understand why Pickard has received so many awards. She is a great American author; in my opinion on the same level as Twain and Steinbeck. This book is a MUST READ.

I like the cartoon like cinematic style, voice acting is great, and the puzzles are (mostly) fair.  We all gather round and play as a family.  Great puzzle solving fun for parents and kids together.  The user interface isn't perfect. Dragging Guybrush around with the mouse can be a bit difficult(you can also use the arrow keys on the keyboard), and sometimes the camera angles can be a problem.  Also the lip sync is terrible, which is a little distracting at first.   You can subscribe to all 5 episodes at once and get a break on the single episode price(I did).  At this writing, only the first 2 episodes are available, with new ones scheduled monthly.
